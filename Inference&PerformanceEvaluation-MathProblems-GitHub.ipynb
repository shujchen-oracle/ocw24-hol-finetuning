      "1. First, we need to find the numbers of men's and women's bathing suits. For men's suits, we multiply the total number by each style percentage: 14,797 x 40% = 5,919 for style A; 14,797 x 35% = 5,179 for style B; and 14,797 x 25% = 3,699 for style C.\n",

      "3. Now, we add the suits for each style to get the total: Style A - 5,919, Style B - 5,179, Style C - 3,699, Style X - 2,733, and Style Y - 2,236. The total number of bathing suits is 17,737.\n",

      "Question: To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n",
      "1. First, let's manipulate the equations to put them in a more standard form. The equation for the total number of peaches is already in a good format, so we'll keep that as-is:\n",
      "10x = r*x + g*x\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For the red peaches equation:\n",
      "4x - x = r*x ⇒ 3x = r*x\n",
      "Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n",
      "x = r*x / 3\n",
      "\n",
      "3. For the green peaches:\n",
      "6x - x = g*x ⇒ 5x = g*x\n",

      "x = g*x / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Now, we'll solve for x by equating the values of x we found in the red and green peaches equations:\n",
      "r*x / 3 = g*x / 5\n",

      "Multiplying both sides by 3/5, we get:\n",
      "r*x = g*x\n",
      "\n",
      "We can see that both equations hold true when r = g.\n",

      "5. Finally, we can solve for x by plugging this value into the original total peaches equation:\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Finally, we divide by the percentage of seats sold to give the number of performances required: 2532 / 0.8 = 3165 seats sold. Again, we round this down to the nearest whole number as it represents the minimum number of performances required.\n",
