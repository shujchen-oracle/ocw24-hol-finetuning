1,"Isha’s pencil is 31.25 inches long. After she sharpens it, the pencil is only 14.75 inches long. How much did she sharpen off of her pencil?","To find out how much of the pencil was sharpened off, you subtract the length of the pencil after sharpening from the length of the pencil before sharpening.

So, 31.25 inches (before sharpening) - 14.75 inches (after sharpening) = 16.5 inches.

Isha sharpened off 16.5 inches of her pencil.","Isha initially had a 31.25-inch pencil, which shrank to 14.75 inches after sharpening. We need to find the difference between these two lengths to determine the amount sharpened off. 

Here are the steps to solve:
1. Subtract the length after sharpening from the initial length: 31.25 inches - 14.75 inches = 16.5 inches.

16 1/2 inches were sharpened off the pencil.
 
The final result: 16.5 inches.","To find out how much Isha sharpened off her pencil, we need to subtract the length of the pencil after sharpening from the original length of the pencil before sharpening.

2,"Mrs. Santiago has 58 red roses, 45 white roses, and 32 yellow roses. Mrs. Garrett has 24 red roses, 67 white roses, and 18 yellow roses. How many more red roses does Mrs. Santiago have than Mrs. Garrett, after they both gave away 10 red roses, and received 5 additional red roses each?","First, let's calculate the number of red roses Mrs. Santiago and Mrs. Garrett have after they gave away 10 red roses and received 5 additional red roses each.

Mrs. Santiago's red roses after giving away and receiving:
58 (original) - 10 (given away) + 5 (received) = 53 red roses

Mrs. Garrett's red roses after giving away and receiving:
24 (original) - 10 (given away) + 5 (received) = 19 red roses

Now, let's find out how many more red roses Mrs. Santiago has than Mrs. Garrett:

53 (Mrs. Santiago's red roses) - 19 (Mrs. Garrett's red roses) = 34 more red roses

Mrs. Santiago has 34 more red roses than Mrs. Garrett.","Mrs. Santiago has 58 - 10 + 5 = 53 red roses.
Mrs. Garrett has 24 - 10 + 5 = 29 red roses.
Mrs. Santiago has 53 - 29 = 24 more red roses than Mrs. Garrett.

Twenty-four.","Mrs. Santiago has 58 red roses.
Mrs. Garrett has 24 red roses.

To find out how many more red roses Mrs. Santiago has than Mrs. Garrett, we subtract the number of red roses Mrs. Garrett has from the number of red roses Mrs. Santiago has:

58 (Mrs. Santiago's red roses) - 24 (Mrs. Garrett's red roses) = 34

So, Mrs. Santiago has 34 more red roses than Mrs. Garrett.

Now, let's consider the effect of giving away 10 red roses and receiving 5 additional red roses each.

Mrs. Santiago gives away 10 red roses, so her number of red roses becomes:

58 (original red roses) - 10 (given away) = 48

Mrs. Garrett gives away 10 red roses, so her number of red roses becomes:

24 (original red roses) - 10 (given away) = 14

Now, let's add the 5 additional red roses each receives:

Mrs. Santiago's new number of red roses = 48 (original red roses after giving away 10) + 5 (additional red roses) = 53

Mrs. Garrett's new number of red roses = 14 (original red roses after giving away 10) + 5 (additional red roses) = 19

Now, let's find out how many more red roses Mrs. Santiago has than Mrs. Garrett after giving away 10 red roses and receiving 5 additional red roses each:

53 (Mrs. Santiago's new red roses) - 19 (Mrs. Garrett's new red roses) = 34

So, after giving away 10 red roses and receiving 5 additional red roses each, Mrs. Santiago still has 34 more red roses than Mrs. Garrett.",Twenty-four,34,34
3,"Diana has 12480 erasers. If she wants to give each friend 87 erasers, how many friends can she share them with?","To find out how many friends Diana can share her erasers with, we need to divide the total number of erasers by the number of erasers she wants to give to each friend.

Total erasers = 12480

Number of friends = 12480 / 87

Now, let's do the division:

Number of friends = 143.44827586206896

Since Diana can't give erasers to a fraction of a friend, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of friends Diana can share with = 143

5,"In basketball, Lukas initially averages 12 points per game. His average increases by 2 points each game. How many points would he score in total over a series of 5 games?","To find the total points Lukas would score over a series of 5 games, we need to calculate the points he scores in each game and then sum them up.

Game 1: 12 points (initial average)
Game 2: 12 + 2 = 14 points (average increases by 2 points)
Game 3: 14 + 2 = 16 points (average increases by 2 points)
Game 4: 16 + 2 = 18 points (average increases by 2 points)
Game 5: 18 + 2 = 20 points (average increases by 2 points)

7,"Arthur baked 115 muffins. James baked an unknown multiple of Arthur's number of muffins plus an additional unknown amount, and the total number of muffins James baked was a palindrome number between 900 and 1200. How many muffins did James bake?","Let's denote the unknown multiple as \( m \) and the additional unknown amount as \( a \). We know that James baked \( m \times 115 + a \) muffins, and this number is a palindrome between 900 and 1200.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. In the range given (900 to 1200), the possible palindromes are 909, 919, 929, ..., up to 1199. However, since we're looking for a number that is a multiple of 115 plus an additional amount, we can eliminate any palindromes that are not multiples of 5, because any multiple of 115 (which is a multiple of 5) will end in 0 or 5.

So, the possible palindromic numbers that are multiples of 5 are:  905, 915, 925, ..., up to 1195.

Now, we need to find a palindrome in this range that is a multiple of 115. We can do this by dividing each palindrome by 115 and checking if the result is an integer.

Let's start with the smallest palindrome, 905, and divide by 115:
905 / 115 = 7.8696 (not an integer)

Next, 915:
915 / 115 = 7.9565 (not an integer)

Next, 925:
925 / 115 = 8.0435 (not an integer)

We continue this process until we find a palindrome that is divisible by 115.

Let's check 935:
935 / 115 = 8.1304 (not an integer)

Now, 945:
945 / 115 = 8.2174 (not an integer)

Let's check 955:
955 / 115 = 8.3043 (not an integer)

Now, 965:
965 / 115 = 8.3913 (not an integer)

Let's check 975:
975 / 115 = 8.4783 (not an integer)

Now, 985:
985 / 115 = 8.5652 (not an integer)

Let's check 995:
995 / 115 = 8.6522 (not an integer)

Now, 1005:
1005 / 115 = 8.7391 (not an integer)

Let's check 1015:
1015 / 115 = 8.8261 (not an integer)

Now, 1025:
1025 / 115 = 8.9130 (not an integer)

Let's check 1035:
1035 / 115 = 9 (an integer)

So, 1035 is a palindrome, it's between 900 and 1200, and it's a multiple of 115. Therefore, James baked 1035 muffins.","Arthur baked 115 muffins, so James's initial number of muffins is a multiple of 115. The palindrome number between 900 and 1200 narrows it down to just two options: 1001 and 1111. 

We know that the number of muffins James baked is greater than the number Arthur baked plus an unknown additional amount. Only one number fits this description: 1111 is greater than 115 plus any possible additional amount and still falls within the given range. 

Therefore, James baked **1111** muffins.","Let's denote the multiple of Arthur's number of muffins that James baked as \( x \) and the additional unknown amount as \( y \).

According to the information given, Arthur baked 115 muffins, so James baked \( x \times 115 \) muffins.

The total number of muffins James baked is a palindrome number between 900 and 1200. The only palindrome numbers in this range are 909, 1001, 1111, and 1212.

Let's check each of these palindrome numbers to see if they match the total number of muffins James baked.

If the total number of muffins is 909, then \( x \times 115 + y = 909 \).

Since 909 is a palindrome, we can write it as \( 9 \times 101 \).

So, \( x \times 115 + y = 9 \times 101 \).

To find \( y \), we need to solve for \( y \) in this equation. We can do this by first finding \( x \) and then using that to find \( y \).

Let's find \( x \):

\( x \times 115 = 9 \times 101 \)

\( x = \frac{9 \times 101}{115} \)

\( x = \frac{909}{115} \)

\( x = 8 \)

Now we know that James baked \( 8 \times 115 = 920 \) muffins by multiplying Arthur's number of muffins.

To find \( y \), we subtract the number of muffins James baked from the total number of muffins:

\( y = 909 - 920 \)

\( y = -111 \)

Since the total number of muffins must be a positive number, we have a contradiction. This means that the total number of muffins James baked cannot be 909.

Let's check the other palindrome numbers:

If the total number of muffins is 1001, then \( x \times 115 + y = 1001 \).

\( x \times 115 = 1001 - y \)

\( x = \frac{1001 - y}{115} \)

\( x = \frac{1001}{115} \)

\( x = 9 \)

Now we know that James baked \( 9 \times",1111,9,1035

Two weeks later, she attended a third concert, where the number of people in attendance was twice the number of people at the second concert minus 150. How many people were at the third concert?","First, let's find out how many people attended the second concert. Since it had 119 more people than the first concert, we add 119 to the number of people who attended the first concert:

66,899 (first concert) + 119 = 67,018 people at the second concert.

Now, let's find out how many people were at the third concert. The third concert had twice the number of people as the second concert minus 150. So we multiply the number of people at the second concert by 2 and then subtract 150:

2 * 67,018 (second concert) - 150 = 134,036 - 150 = 133,886 people at the third concert.","We denote the attendance of the second concert as x. The attendance of the third concert can be found by the equation 2x - 150. We know that the attendance of the second concert is 66,899 + 119 = 67,018 people.

Plugging in the value, we find that the third concert had 134,036 people in attendance.

Therefore, the final answer is 134036.","Let's denote the number of people at the first concert as C1. According to the information given, C1 = 66,899.

The second concert had 119 more people than the first concert, so the number of people at the second concert is C2 = C1 + 119 = 66,899 + 119 = 67,018.

The third concert had twice the number of people at the second concert minus 150, so the number of people at the third concert is C3 = 2 * C2 - 150 = 2 * 67,018 - 150 = 134,036 - 150 = 133,886.

Therefore, there were 133,886 people at the third concert.",134036,"133,886","133,886"

Small packages: 5 packages * 6 Lemon Heads each = 30 Lemon Heads
Medium packages: 3 packages * 15 Lemon Heads each = 45 Lemon Heads
Large packages: 2 packages * 30 Lemon Heads each = 60 Lemon Heads

Total Lemon Heads = 30 (from small) + 45 (from medium) + 60 (from large) = 135 Lemon Heads

And 2 x 30 = 60 Lemon Heads from the large packages.
So in total, Louis has 30 + 45 + 60 = 135 Lemon Heads.
After Louis ate 54, there were 135 - 54 = 81 Lemon Heads left.
Dividing the remaining Lemon Heads equally among Louis and his 4 friends gives them each 81 / 5 = 16.2 Lemon Heads.
Since we can't share 0.2 of a Lemon Head, Louis and his friends should each receive 16 Lemon Heads.
Louis has 81 - 4 x 16 = 21 Lemon Heads left.
**21**","First, let's calculate the total number of Lemon Heads Louis bought:

Small packages contain 6 Lemon Heads each, so 5 small packages contain:
5 * 6 = 30 Lemon Heads

Medium packages contain 15 Lemon Heads each, so 3 medium packages contain:
3 * 15 = 45 Lemon Heads

Large packages contain 30 Lemon Heads each, so 2 large packages contain:
2 * 30 = 60 Lemon Heads

Now, let's add up all the Lemon Heads Louis bought:
30 (from small packages) + 45 (from medium packages) + 60 (from large packages) = 135 Lemon Heads

Next, we need to find out how many Lemon Heads Louis has left after eating 54 of them:
135 (total Lemon Heads) - 54 (Lemon Heads eaten) = 81 Lemon Heads left

Now, let's find out how many Lemon Heads each friend gets when they share the remaining Lemon Heads equally:
81 (Lemon Heads left) ÷ 4 (friends) = 20.25 Lemon Heads per friend

Since we can't have a fraction of a Lemon Head, we'll have to round down to the nearest whole number. Each friend will get 20 Lemon Heads.

Now, let's find out how many whole boxes each friend gets:
20 (Lemon Heads per friend) ÷ 6 (Lemon Heads per small box) = 3.333333333...

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll have to round down to the nearest whole number. Each friend will get 3 whole boxes.

Finally, let's find out how many Lemon Heads Louis has left:
81 (Lemon Heads left) - 20 (Lemon Heads per friend) * 4 (friends) = 21 Lemon Heads left

So, each friend gets 3 whole boxes and 20 individual Lemon Heads. Louis has 21 Lemon Heads left.",21,21,2
15,"Tim had $1.50 in his wallet. He decided to buy a candy bar for 45 cents, a bag of chips for 65 cents, and a small toy for 40 cents. The store was currently offering a 10% discount on snacks (candy bar and chips). How much change will Tim get after his purchases?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the snacks (candy bar and chips) before the discount:

Candy bar: $0.45
Bag of chips: $0.65
Total cost of snacks: $0.45 + $0.65 = $1.10

Now, let's calculate the 10% discount on the snacks:

10% of $1.10 = 0.10 * $1.10 = $0.11

So, the discount amount is $0.11.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost of the snacks:

$1.10 - $0.11 = $0.99

Now, let's add the cost of the small toy:

Small toy: $0.40

Total cost after discount and including the toy:

$0.99 (snacks after discount) + $0.40 (toy) = $1.39

Now, let's calculate the change Tim will get after his purchases:

Tim had $1.50 originally.

Change = Original amount - Total cost after discount
Change = $1.50 - $1.39
Change = $0.11

Tim will get $0.11 in change after his purchases.","Tim started with $1.50. For the candy bar (45c) and the bag of chips (65c) he pays $0.107, because 45c + 65c = 110c, and with the 10% discount this becomes 99c. The small toy costs 40c. In total, Tim's purchases come to $1.49, which means he will get 1 cent in change. 

**1 cent**","First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

Candy bar: 45 cents
Bag of chips: 65 cents
Small toy: 40 cents

Total cost before discount = 45 cents + 65 cents + 40 cents = $1.50

Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the cost of the snacks (candy bar and chips):

Discount on snacks = 10% of $1.50 = 0.10 * $1.50 = $0.15

Let's subtract the discount from the total cost before discount:

Total cost after discount = $1.50 - $0.15 = $1.35

Now, let's add the cost of the small toy to the total cost after discount:

Total cost after discount + small toy = $1.35 + $0.40 = $1.75

Tim started with $1.50, so to find out how much change he will get, we subtract the total cost after discount from his starting amount:

Change = $1.50 - $1.75 = -$0.25

Since Tim cannot get negative change, we need to check our calculations. The total cost after discount should not be more than the amount Tim started with. Let's check our math:

Total cost after discount = $1.35
Total cost before discount = $1.50

The total cost after discount should not exceed the total cost before discount, which is $1.50. However, our calculation shows that the total cost after discount is $1.35, which is less than $1.50. This means our calculations are correct, and Tim will get $0.25 in change.",cent,-$0.25,0.11
16,"Lino picked up x shells in the first hour at the seashore, where x is a fraction representing the number of shells. In the second hour, he picked up (x + 32) shells. If the total number of shells he picked up in both hours is represented by y, find the value of y in terms of x.","To find the total number of shells Lino picked up in both hours, we simply add the number of shells he picked up in the first hour to the number of shells he picked up in the second hour.

In the first hour, he picked up x shells.
In the second hour, he picked up (x + 32) shells.

So, the total number of shells, y, is:

y = x (first hour) + (x + 32) (second hour)
y = x + x + 32
y = 2x + 32

Therefore, the value of y in terms of x is y = 2x + 32.","We are asked to find the total number of shells, y, picked up by Lino over two hours. We are given that in the first hour, Lino picked up x shells, and in the second hour, he picked up (x + 32) shells. 

We can add the two expressions to find y: 
 y = x + (x + 32) 

Simplifying this expression shows that y = 2x + 32.

Therefore, the result is 2x + 32.
Shells: 2x + 32","Let's denote the fraction representing the number of shells Lino picked up in the first hour as x/y, where y is the total number of shells he picked up in both hours.

In the second hour, he picked up (x + 32) shells.

The total number of shells he picked up in both hours is the sum of the shells he picked up in the first hour and the shells he picked up in the second hour. So, the total number of shells is:

y = x/y + (x + 32)

To solve for y, we need to express x/y in terms of x and y. Since x/y is a fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by y to get rid of the fraction:

y * (x/y) + (x + 32) = y

Now, we have:

x + (x + 32) = y

Combine like terms:

x + x + 32 = y
2x + 32 = y

Now, subtract 32 from both sides to solve for y:

2x + 32 - 32 = y
2x = y

So, the total number of shells Lino picked up in both hours is 2 times the fraction of shells he picked up in the first hour. In terms of x, y = 2x.",32,2x,2x + 32

24 bees * 6 legs/bee = 144 legs

Since there are 8 bees of each type and there are 3 types, it doesn't change the total number of legs because we still have 24 bees in total. So, regardless of the types, 24 bees would have 144 legs in total.","We know that one bee has 6 legs, and there are 24 bees in total, so to find the total number of legs, we multiply the number of legs per bee by the total number of bees:

Johnny ran at a speed of 3 laps per minute, George at a rate of 5 laps every two minutes, and Sally with a speed of 4 laps per minute. If they all ran continuously, how many minutes would it take for all three of them to complete a combined total of 60 laps?","To find out how many minutes it would take for all three of them to complete a combined total of 60 laps, we need to calculate the total number of laps they can run per minute and then divide 60 by that number.

Johnny's speed is 3 laps per minute.
George's speed is 5 laps every two minutes, which is equivalent to 5/2 = 2.5 laps per minute.
Sally's speed is 4 laps per minute.

Now, let's add up their speeds to find the total number of laps they can complete per minute:

Total laps per minute = Johnny's speed + George's speed + Sally's speed
Total laps per minute = 3 laps/min + 2.5 laps/min + 4 laps/min
Total laps per minute = 9.5 laps/min

Now, we divide the total number of laps they need to complete by the total number of laps they can complete per minute:

Time (in minutes) = Total laps / Total laps per minute
Time (in minutes) = 60 laps / 9.5 laps/min
Time (in minutes) = 60 / 9.5
Time (in minutes) = 6.31578947...

Since they can't run a fraction of a minute, we'll round up to the nearest whole minute. It would take them approximately 7 minutes to complete a combined total of 60 laps.","To determine the number of minutes needed for Johnny, George, and Sally to complete a combined total of 60 laps, we must ascertain the rate at which they complete each lap. 

Johnny runs three laps in one minute, George achieves five laps every two minutes, and Sally finishes four laps in one minute. 

We can calculate the time required for George to complete one lap by dividing the number of laps by the rate: 1 lap / (5 laps / 2 minutes) = 0.5 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time needed: 
Johnny: 60 laps / 3 laps per minute = 20 minutes 
George: 60 laps / 5 laps every 2 minutes = 12 minutes
Sally: 60 laps / 4 laps per minute = 15 minutes. 

The total time is the sum of these values: 20 + 12 + 15 = 47 minutes.

Therefore, 47 minutes is the answer.","First, let's find out how many laps each person completes in one minute:

Johnny runs at a speed of 3 laps per minute.
George runs at a rate of 5 laps every two minutes, so in one minute, he would complete 5 laps / 2 = 2.5 laps.
Sally runs at a speed of 4 laps per minute.

Now, let's calculate the total laps completed by all three in one minute:

Johnny's laps per minute = 3
George's laps per minute = 2.5
Sally's laps per minute = 4

Total laps per minute = Johnny's laps + George's laps + Sally's laps
Total laps per minute = 3 + 2.5 + 4
Total laps per minute = 9.5

Now, let's find out how many minutes it would take for them to complete 60 laps:

60 laps / Total laps per minute = 60 / 9.5

To divide 60 by 9.5, we can multiply by the reciprocal of 9.5, which is 1 / 9.5:

60 * (1 / 9.5) = 60 / 9.5

Now, let's calculate the result:

60 / 9.5 = 6.30

Since we can't have a fraction of a minute, we need to round to the nearest whole number. Since 6.30 is closer to 6 than to 7, we can round to 6 minutes.

Therefore, it would take approximately 6 minutes for all three of them to complete a combined total of 60 laps.",47,6,7

After giving away the trucks, Sarah has 38 trucks left. This means that the total number of trucks she had before giving any away was the sum of the trucks she gave to Jeff, the trucks she gave to Emily, and the trucks she has left.

So, the equation to represent this situation is:

Number of trucks Sarah started with = Trucks given to Jeff + Trucks given to Emily + Trucks left with Sarah

Let's plug in the numbers we know:

Number of trucks Sarah started with = 13 (given to Jeff) + E (given to Emily) + 38 (left with Sarah)

Now, we can solve for the number of trucks Sarah started with:

Number of trucks Sarah started with = 13 + E + 38

Combine the known numbers:

Number of trucks Sarah started with = 51 + E

Since we don't have any more information to find the exact value of E, we can't determine the exact number of trucks Sarah started with or the number she gave to Emily. We need more information to solve for E. If there's additional information provided, such as the total number of trucks Sarah gave away, we could solve for E and then determine the total number of trucks Sarah had initially.","Sarah had 59 trucks to start with, and she gave Emily 14 trucks.
59.","Let's denote the number of trucks Sarah gave to Emily as \( x \).

According to the information given, Sarah had some trucks, and after giving 13 trucks to Jeff and \( x \) trucks to Emily, she was left with 38 trucks.

So we can write the equation:

\( \text{Number of trucks Sarah had} - 13 - x = 38 \)

Now, let's solve for the number of trucks Sarah had to start with and the number of trucks she gave to Emily.

First, let's isolate the term with \( x \):

\( \text{Number of trucks Sarah had} - 13 - x = 38 \)
\( \text{Number of trucks Sarah had} - 13 = 38 + x \)

Now, let's solve for the number of trucks Sarah had:

\( \text{Number of trucks Sarah had} = 38 + x + 13 \)
\( \text{Number of trucks Sarah had} = 51 + x \)

Now we know that Sarah had 51 trucks to start with.

To find out how many trucks she gave to Emily, we simply subtract the number of trucks she gave to Jeff and the number of trucks she has left from the total number of trucks she had:

\( x = \text{Number of trucks Sarah had} - \text{Number of trucks Sarah gave to Jeff} - \text{Number of trucks Sarah has left} \)
\( x = 51 - 13 - 38 \)
\( x = 51 - 51 \)
\( x = 0 \)

So Sarah gave 0 trucks to Emily. This means that Emily received no trucks from Sarah.",41,0,51 + E

500 pieces * $0.25/piece = $125.00

Now, let's calculate the 10% discount on the total cost:

10% of $125.00 = 0.10 * $125.00 = $12.50

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

$125.00 - $12.50 = $112.50

Now, let's calculate the 7% sales tax on the discounted price:

7% of $112.50 = 0.07 * $112.50 = $7.875

Since sales tax is generally rounded to the nearest cent, we'll round $7.875 to $7.88.

Finally, add the sales tax to the discounted price to get the final cost:

27,"During last season, Jorge scored 156 goals and had 82 assists in 45 games played. This season he scored 187 goals and had 94 assists in 50 games played. Calculate Jorge's overall performance ratio (goals + assists per game) for both seasons.","To calculate Jorge's overall performance ratio for both seasons, we need to add the goals and assists together for each season and then divide by the number of games played in that season.

For last season:
Total points (goals + assists) = 156 goals + 82 assists = 238 points
Number of games played = 45 games
Performance ratio = Total points / Number of games played
Performance ratio = 238 points / 45 games ≈ 5.29 points per game

For this season:
Total points (goals + assists) = 187 goals + 94 assists = 281 points
Number of games played = 50 games
Performance ratio = Total points / Number of games played
Performance ratio = 281 points / 50 games = 5.62 points per game

So, Jorge's overall performance ratio was approximately 5.29 points per game last season and 5.62 points per game this season.","Last season:  (156 + 82) / 45 = 5.00
This season:  (187 + 94) / 50 = 5.34
Overall:  5.17

Impressive!","Last season, Jorge's overall performance ratio was:
(Goals + Assists) / Games Played
= (156 + 82) / 45
= 238 / 45
= 5.29 goals + assists per game

This season, Jorge's overall performance ratio was:
(Goals + Assists) / Games Played
= (187 + 94) / 50
= 281 / 50
= 5.62 goals + assists per game

To find the overall performance ratio for both seasons combined, we add the goals and assists from both seasons and then divide by the total number of games played:

Total goals = 156 (last season) + 187 (this season) = 343
Total assists = 82 (last season) + 94 (this season) = 176
Total games played = 45 (last season) + 50 (this season) = 95

Overall performance ratio for both seasons = (Total goals + Total assists) / Total games played

28,"You have a budget of 224 cents to buy a variety of candies. Each piece of bulk candy costs 8 cents, gummy bears cost 6 cents each, and gumdrops cost 4 cents each. If you need to buy at least 10 pieces of bulk candy and 5 gummy bears, what is the maximum number of gumdrops that can be purchased?","First, let's calculate the minimum amount of money that needs to be spent on bulk candy and gummy bears.

For bulk candy, at 8 cents each, buying at least 10 pieces will cost:
10 pieces * 8 cents/piece = 80 cents

For gummy bears, at 6 cents each, buying at least 5 pieces will cost:
5 pieces * 6 cents/piece = 30 cents

Now, let's add the cost of the minimum required bulk candy and gummy bears:
80 cents (bulk candy) + 30 cents (gummy bears) = 110 cents

Subtract this amount from the total budget to find out how much is left for gumdrops:
224 cents (total budget) - 110 cents (bulk candy and gummy bears) = 114 cents

Now, let's calculate how many gumdrops can be bought with the remaining budget. Since gumdrops cost 4 cents each:
114 cents / 4 cents/gumdrop = 28.5 gumdrops

Since you can't buy half a gumdrop, you can buy a maximum of 28 gumdrops with the remaining budget.","To solve this problem, we should first find out the cost of the 10 mandatory bulk candies (10 x 8 cents = 80 cents) and 5 gummy bears (5 x 6 cents = 30 cents), which amounts to 110 cents in total. We then subtract this amount from the total budget to find the remaining budget for gumdrops: 224 cents - 110 cents = 114 cents. This means that the maximum number of gumdrops that can be purchased is 114 cents / 4 cents per gumdrop = 28.5, or 29 if we round up. 

Twenty-nine is the final result.","First, let's calculate the total cost of the bulk candy and gummy bears:

Cost of bulk candy = 10 pieces * 8 cents/piece = 80 cents
Cost of gummy bears = 5 pieces * 6 cents/piece = 30 cents

Now, let's add the cost of the bulk candy and gummy bears to find out how much money is left for gumdrops:

Total cost = Cost of bulk candy + Cost of gummy bears
Total cost = 80 cents + 30 cents
Total cost = 110 cents

Now, let's find out how much money is left for gumdrops:

Money left for gumdrops = Total budget - Total cost
Money left for gumdrops = 224 cents - 110 cents
Money left for gumdrops = 114 cents

Now, let's find out the maximum number of gumdrops that can be purchased with the money left:

Maximum number of gumdrops = Money left for gumdrops / Cost of each gumdrop
Maximum number of gumdrops = 114 cents / 4 cents/piece
Maximum number of gumdrops = 28.5

For the 30 schools with 350 students each:
30 schools * 350 students/school = 10500 students

For the 15 schools with 400 students each:
15 schools * 400 students/school = 6000 students

Now, we add the number of students from each group of schools to find the total number of students:

After exchanging some bottle caps with her friend, for every 5 bottle caps she gave away, she received 3 new ones in return. How many bottle caps does Nancy end up with?","First, let's calculate how many bottle caps Nancy has after finding more and tripling her collection:

Starting bottle caps: 91
Bottle caps found: 88

Total before tripling: 91 + 88 = 179

After tripling her collection: 179 * 3 = 537

Now, let's account for the bottle caps she loses:

Bottle caps after losing some: 537 - 55 = 482

Next, we need to determine how many bottle caps she exchanges and how many she ends up with after the exchange. Since we don't have the exact number of bottle caps she exchanged, we can't calculate the exact number of bottle caps she has after the exchange. However, we can express the final amount in terms of the number of bottle caps she exchanged.

Let's say Nancy exchanges x bottle caps. For every 5 bottle caps she gives away, she receives 3 in return. This means that for every 5x bottle caps she gives away, she receives 3x in return.

So, after the exchange, Nancy's total bottle caps would be:

482 - 5x (the number of bottle caps she gives away) + 3x (the number of bottle caps she receives in return)

Simplifying this, we get:

482 - 5x + 3x = 482 - 2x

Without the value of x, we cannot determine the exact number of bottle caps Nancy ends up with. If you provide the number of bottle caps she exchanged, we can calculate the final amount.","Nancy has 91 bottle caps initially and finds 88 more, resulting in 179 bottle caps. Tripling her collection means she has 537 bottle caps. After losing 55 of them, she's left with 482.

Combined weight of the other three: 140.9 pounds

Heather's weight - Combined weight of the other three:

Ryan has 17 blocks and 9 friends.

17 blocks ÷ 9 friends = 1 block per friend with a remainder.

17 blocks - (1 block/friend × 9 friends) = 17 blocks - 9 blocks = 8 blocks left.

So, each friend gets 1 block, and there are 8 blocks left.

Now, let's distribute the marbles. Ryan has 72 marbles to distribute among his 9 friends.

72 marbles ÷ 9 friends = 8 marbles per friend.

Her sister added 12 gallons of gas to the car, which has a fuel consumption of 24 miles per gallon. How many miles did they have left to drive and will they need to stop for gas again before they reach the concert?","First, let's calculate how many miles Mrs. Hilt and her sister had left to drive after stopping for gas. They had already driven 48 miles, so:

Total distance to concert - Distance already driven = Distance left to drive
156 miles - 48 miles = 108 miles left to drive

Next, let's determine if they will need to stop for gas again before they reach the concert. To do this, we need to calculate the total range they can drive with the 12 gallons of gas they added to the car. Since the car has a fuel consumption of 24 miles per gallon, we can calculate the range as follows:

Fuel added (in gallons) x Fuel consumption (miles per gallon) = Total range
12 gallons x 24 miles/gallon = 288 miles

Since the total range they can drive with the 12 gallons of gas is 288 miles, which is more than the 108 miles they have left to drive, they will not need to stop for gas again before they reach the concert.","Let's solve this together!

First, we need to calculate how many miles the car can drive on the gas added: 12 gallons * 24 miles/gallon = 288 miles.

Next, we'll subtract the distance they've already driven to find out how many miles they have left: 288 miles - 48 miles = 240 miles. 

So, they have 240 miles left to drive. They will not need to stop for gas again as this is enough to reach their destination. 

**240**","First, let's calculate the distance they can drive with the 12 gallons of gas they added. Since the fuel consumption is 24 miles per gallon, we can multiply the number of gallons by the fuel consumption to get the total distance they can drive:

Now, let's subtract the distance they can drive with the added gas from the total distance they need to cover to reach the concert:

156 miles (total distance) - 288 miles (distance with added gas) = 68 miles

This means they have 68 miles left to drive.

To determine if they will need to stop for gas again before they reach the concert, we need to know the total distance they have left to drive and the fuel consumption of the car. Since they have 68 miles left to drive and the fuel consumption is 24 miles per gallon, we can calculate the number of gallons they will need to cover the remaining distance:

68 miles / 24 miles/gallon = 2.833 gallons

After a while, 40% of the ducks, 25% of the geese, and 30% of the swans fly away from the lake. How many ducks are left swimming in the lake?","First, let's calculate the total number of ducks, geese, and swans after the new ones join:

Ducks: 13 (original) + 20 (new) = 33 ducks
Geese: 11 (original) + 15 (new) = 26 geese
Swans: 9 (original) + 7 (new) = 16 swans

Next, let's calculate how many of each type fly away:

Ducks flying away: 40% of 33 = 0.40 * 33 = 13.2 ducks
Since we can't have a fraction of a duck, we'll round this to 13 ducks flying away.

Geese flying away: 25% of 26 = 0.25 * 26 = 6.5 geese
Since we can't have a fraction of a geese, we'll round this to 7 geese flying away (since 6 would be less than 25%).

Swans flying away: 30% of 16 = 0.30 * 16 = 4.8 swans
Since we can't have a fraction of a swan, we'll round this to 5 swans flying away (since 4 would be less than 30%).

Now, let's calculate how many of each type are left:

Ducks left: 33 (total) - 13 (flying away) = 20 ducks
Geese left: 26 (total) - 7 (flying away) = 19 geese
Swans left: 16 (total) - 5 (flying away) = 11 swans

Therefore, there are 20 ducks left swimming in the lake.","There are initially 13 ducks + 11 geese + 9 swans = 33 birds swimming in the lake. Later, 20 ducks + 15 geese + 7 swans = 42 birds join them, making a total of 33 + 42 = 75 birds. 
After some time, 40% of ducks (40% * 13 ducks = 5.2 ducks) and 25% of the geese (25% * 11 geese = 2.75 geese) and 30% of the swans (30% * 9 swans = 2.7 swans) fly away. 
We round the number of flying-away ducks to 5 and the number of geese to 3 for ease of calculation.

Cost of 1 ball = $1.54
Cost of 3 balls = 3 * $1.54 = $4.62

Now, let's calculate the sales tax for the 3 balls:

Sales tax rate = 7.5%
Sales tax for 3 balls = 7.5% of $4.62

To find 7.5% of $4.62, we convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by the total cost before tax:

Sales tax = 0.075 * $4.62 = $0.3465

Since we usually round to the nearest cent, the sales tax would be approximately $0.35.

Finally, let's add the sales tax to the total cost before tax to find out how much Kyoko must pay:

Total cost before tax = $4.62
Sales tax = $0.35
Total cost after tax = $4.62 + $0.35 = $4.97

Adding the tax to the cost of the balls gives us the final price: $4.62 + $0.3465 = $4.9665, or $5. 

Therefore, the final result is **five**.","First, let's calculate the total cost of the 3 balls before tax:

Total cost of balls = Number of balls × Cost per ball
Total cost of balls = 3 × $1.54

Sales tax = Total cost of balls × Sales tax percentage
Sales tax = $4.62 × 0.075
Sales tax = $0.3456

Since the sales tax is usually rounded to the nearest cent, we'll round $0.3456 to $0.35.

Theater A has 750 seats and 532 people are watching the movie, so the number of empty seats in Theater A is:
750 seats - 532 people = 218 empty seats

Theater B has 1000 seats and 634 people are watching the movie, so the number of empty seats in Theater B is:

Total number of people in Theater A = 532
Total number of people in Theater B = 634
Total number of people in both theaters = 532 + 634 = 1166 people

Revenue from Theater A = Ticket price in Theater A * Number of people in Theater A
Revenue from Theater A = $10 * 532 = $5320

Revenue from Theater B = Ticket price in Theater B * Number of people in Theater B
Revenue from Theater B = $12 * 634 = $7608

Combined revenue from both theaters = Revenue from Theater A + Revenue from Theater B
Combined revenue from both theaters = $5320 + $7608 = $12928

Empty seats in Theater B = 1000 - 634
Empty seats in Theater B = 366

**Total number of people watching the movie in both theaters:**
Total people watching the movie = People watching the movie in Theater A + People watching the movie in Theater B
Total people watching the movie = 532 + 634
Total people watching the movie = 1166

**Combined revenue generated from ticket sales in both theaters:**
Revenue from Theater A = Empty seats in Theater A * Ticket price for Theater A
Revenue from Theater A = 218 * $10
Revenue from Theater A = $2180

Revenue from Theater B = Empty seats in Theater B * Ticket price for Theater B
Revenue from Theater B = 366 * $12
Revenue from Theater B = $4392

Combined revenue = Revenue from Theater A + Revenue from Theater B
Combined revenue = $2180 + $4392
Combined revenue = $6572

So, the number of empty seats in Theater A is 218, the number of empty seats in Theater B is 366, the total number of people watching the movie in both theaters is 1166, and the combined revenue generated from ticket sales in both theaters is $6572.",1898,six thousand five hundred seventy two,12928

If you want to bake 3 cakes with frosting, how much sugar will you need in total for the cakes and frostings?","To calculate the total amount of sugar needed for 3 cakes with frosting, we need to first calculate the sugar needed for one cake and its frosting, and then multiply that by 3.

For one cake:
- Cake part: 0.4 cup of sugar
- Frosting: 0.6 cup of sugar

Total sugar for one cake with frosting:
0.4 cup (cake) + 0.6 cup (frosting) = 1.0 cup of sugar

Now, for 3 cakes with frosting:
1.0 cup of sugar (for one cake with frosting) x 3 cakes = 3.0 cups of sugar

You will need a total of 3.0 cups of sugar for 3 cakes with frosting.","To bake three cakes with frosting, we need to calculate the total sugar required for both the cakes and the frosting.

The cake requires 0.4 cup of sugar for each cake, and we need to make three of them, so that's 1.2 cups in total. The frosting uses 0.6 cups of sugar, and we'll need this amount for each cake.

Multiplying the frosting sugar requirement by three gives us 1.8 cups.

Adding the sugar needed for the cake to the sugar needed for the frosting gives us a total of 3 cups of sugar required.

**3 cups**","To calculate the total amount of sugar needed for the cakes and frostings, we need to multiply the amount of sugar required for one cake by the number of cakes (3).

For the cake part:
Sugar = 0.4 cup

For the frosting part:

Now, we multiply the sugar for one cake by the number of cakes:
Total sugar for cakes = 0.4 cup/cake * 3 cakes = 1.2 cups

Total sugar for frostings = 0.6 cup/frosting * 3 frostings = 1.8 cups

Finally, we add the sugar for the cakes and frostings together:
Total sugar needed = 1.2 cups (for cakes) + 1.8 cups (for frostings) = 3 cups

So, you will need a total of 3 cups of sugar for the cakes and frostings.",3,3,3

If 3 beavers from the gathering wood group, 2 beavers from the strengthening dam group, and 1 beaver from the building the main lodge group decide to take a break and go for a swim, how many beavers are still working on their individual tasks in the beaver colony?","Originally, there were:

- 5 beavers gathering wood
- 4 beavers strengthening their dam
- 3 beavers building the main lodge

If 3 beavers from the wood gathering group, 2 from the dam strengthening group, and 1 from the lodge building group go for a swim, then:

- 5 - 3 = 2 beavers are still gathering wood
- 4 - 2 = 2 beavers are still strengthening their dam
- 3 - 1 = 2 beavers are still building the main lodge

1. Initially, there are 5 beavers gathering wood, 4 strengthening the dam, and 3 building the lodge, totaling 12 beavers working.

2. If some beavers take a break, we subtract the respective numbers from each group:
   - 5 - 3 = 2 beavers still gathering wood
   - 4 - 2 = 2 beavers strengthening the dam
   - 3 - 1 = 2 beavers building the lodge

Original number of marbles: 95
Additional marbles from Henry and Grace: 21

Total before buying cards: 95 + 21 = 116 marbles

Next, let's calculate the number of marbles Evelyn gets from the cards:

Each card gives her 4 marbles, and she buys 6 cards, so:

4 marbles/card × 6 cards = 24 marbles

41,A sandbox is 3.12 meters long and 146 centimeters wide. How many square centimeters of ground does the sandbox cover?,"To find the area of the sandbox in square centimeters, we need to convert all measurements to centimeters and then multiply the length by the width.

The sandbox is 3.12 meters long. Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, we convert the length to centimeters:
3.12 meters * 100 centimeters/meter = 312 centimeters

The width is already given in centimeters as 146 centimeters.

Now we can calculate the area:
Area = Length * Width
Area = 312 centimeters * 146 centimeters
Area = 45552 square centimeters

So, the sandbox covers 45552 square centimeters of ground.","To determine the area of the sandbox, we must first convert the given dimensions to the same unit of measurement as they are currently in different metric units. We'll convert the width, which is currently in centimeters, to meters.
 
Width = 146 cm × 1 m / 100 cm = 1.46 meters
 
Now that both lengths are in meters, we can calculate the area:
 
Length × Width = 3.12 m × 1.46 m = 4.5456 square meters
 
To get the result in square centimeters, we multiply by 10,000:
 
Area = 4.5456 m^2 × 10,000 cm^2 / m^2 = 45,456 square centimeters
 
So the sandbox covers **45,456 square centimeters** of ground.","First, we need to convert the width of the sandbox from centimeters to meters because the length is given in meters. To do this, we divide the width in centimeters by 100 (since there are 100 centimeters in a meter):

146 cm ÷ 100 cm/m = 1.46 meters

Now we have the dimensions of the sandbox in meters:
Length = 3.12 meters
Width = 1.46 meters

Next, we calculate the area of the sandbox by multiplying the length by the width:

Area = Length × Width
Area = 3.12 meters × 1.46 meters
Area = 4.5672 square meters

To find the area in square centimeters, we multiply the area in square meters by 10,000 (since there are 10,000 square centimeters in a square meter):

Area in square centimeters = Area in square meters × 10,000
Area in square centimeters = 4.5672 square meters × 10,000
Area in square centimeters = 45,672 square centimeters

84 boxes * 8 eggs/box = 672 eggs

George has sold 3 boxes of eggs, so he has sold:

3 boxes * 8 eggs/box = 24 eggs

Now, to find out how many eggs George has left after selling 3 boxes, we subtract the number of eggs sold from the initial number of eggs:

672 eggs - 24 eggs = 648 eggs

Therefore, George has 648 eggs now.","George has 7 x 12 = 84 boxes in total.
With each box holding 8 eggs, the total number of eggs is 84 x 8 = 672.

1. 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (measured in grams)
2. 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3. 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
4. 1/2 cup granulated sugar
5. 1 cup packed light-brown sugar
6. 1 teaspoon salt
7. 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
8. 2 large eggs
9. 2 cups semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips (measured in ounces)

You have been asked to make 23 batches of cookies for a bake sale using this specific recipe. How many grams of all-purpose flour, ounces of chocolate chips, and any other required ingredient measurements will be needed to make all 23 batches of cookies according to the recipe?","To make 23 batches of cookies, we need to multiply the quantity of each ingredient by 23. Here's the calculation for each ingredient:

1. All-purpose flour: 2 1/4 cups per batch. First, we need to convert cups to grams. Generally, 1 cup of all-purpose flour is approximately 120 grams. So, 2 1/4 cups would be 2.25 * 120 grams = 270 grams. For 23 batches: 270 grams * 23 = 6210 grams.

2. Baking soda: 1/2 teaspoon per batch. For 23 batches: 0.5 tsp * 23 = 11.5 teaspoons.

3. Unsalted butter: 1 cup per batch. Since there are 16 tablespoons in a cup and 1 tablespoon of butter weighs about 14.2 grams, 1 cup of butter would weigh 16 * 14.2 grams = 227.2 grams. For 23 batches: 227.2 grams * 23 = 5225.6 grams.

4. Granulated sugar: 1/2 cup per batch. Since 1 cup of granulated sugar is approximately 200 grams, 1/2 cup would be 100 grams. For 23 batches: 100 grams * 23 = 2300 grams.

5. Light-brown sugar: 1 cup packed per batch. Packed brown sugar is approximately 220 grams per cup. For 23 batches: 220 grams * 23 = 5060 grams.

6. Salt: 1 teaspoon per batch. For 23 batches: 1 tsp * 23 = 23 teaspoons.

7. Pure vanilla extract: 2 teaspoons per batch. For 23 batches: 2 tsp * 23 = 46 teaspoons.

8. Large eggs: 2 eggs per batch. For 23 batches: 2 eggs * 23 = 46 eggs.

9. Chocolate chips: 2 cups per batch. Since 1 cup of chocolate chips is approximately 6 ounces, 2 cups would be 12 ounces. For 23 batches: 12 ounces * 23 = 276 ounces.

Now, let's summarize the total amount of ingredients needed for 23 batches:

1. All-purpose flour: 6210 grams
2. Baking soda: 11.5 teaspoons
3. Unsalted butter: 5225.6 grams
4. Granulated sugar: 2300 grams
5. Light-brown sugar: 5060 grams
6. Salt: 23 teaspoons
7. Pure vanilla extract: 46 teaspoons
8. Large eggs: 46 eggs
9. Chocolate chips: 276 ounces

Make sure to double-check the conversions and measurements, as different sources may provide slightly different weights for cup measurements.","To solve this, we need to multiply the ingredients' quantities by the number of batches to determine the required ingredient measurements for 23 batches.

Here are the steps:
1. For every 1 batch, we need 2 1/4 cups (or 188g) of flour. To find out the flour needed for 23 batches, we multiply: 188g x 23 = 4324g.

2. 1 batch uses 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, so 23 batches will need: 1 x 23 = 23 teaspoons of baking soda.

3. 1 batch requires 1 cup (226g) of butter. The total butter needed for 23 batches is: 226g x 23 = 5198g.

4. Both the granulated sugar and light-brown sugar are needed at 1/2 cup (115g) and 1 cup (230g) per batch, respectively. We'll multiply the larger amount to ensure we have enough: 230g x 23 = 5390g.

5. 1 teaspoon of salt is used per batch. 23 batches will require: 1 x 23 = 23 teaspoons of salt.

6. 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract are added per batch. This doesn't change when scaling the recipe, so we'll need: 2 x 23 = 46 teaspoons of vanilla extract.

7. Each batch takes 2 large eggs. Multiplying the number of batches: 2 x 23 = 46 eggs.

8. Finally, 2 cups (32 ounces or 64 tbsp) of chocolate chips are used per batch. The total chips needed for 23 batches: 64 x 23 = 1472 ounces or 36368 grams.

So in total, you will need:
- 4324 grams of flour
- 5390 grams of sugar
- 5198 grams of butter
- 46 eggs
- 36368 grams of chocolate chips
- 23 teaspoons of baking soda
- 46 teaspoons of vanilla extract
- 23 teaspoons of salt

The grand total required for 23 batches is: A LOT!","To calculate the total amount of each ingredient needed for 23 batches of cookies, we first need to determine the amount of each ingredient per batch.

For the all-purpose flour, we need to convert the cups to grams. Since 1 cup of all-purpose flour is approximately 125 grams, we can calculate the total grams of flour needed for one batch as follows:

2 1/4 cups = 2.25 cups
2.25 cups * 125 grams/cup = 281.25 grams

Now, let's calculate the total grams of flour needed for 23 batches:

281.25 grams/batch * 23 batches = 6468.75 grams

For the chocolate chips, we need to convert the cups to ounces. Since 1 cup of chocolate chips is approximately 6 ounces, we can calculate the total ounces of chocolate chips needed for one batch as follows:

2 cups * 6 ounces/cup = 12 ounces

Now, let's calculate the total ounces of chocolate chips needed for 23 batches:

12 ounces/batch * 23 batches = 276 ounces

For the other ingredients, we can simply multiply the amount per batch by the number of batches:

- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda * 23 batches = 23/2 teaspoons = 11.5 teaspoons
- 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature * 23 batches = 23 cups
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar * 23 batches = 23/2 cups = 11.5 cups
- 1 cup packed light-brown sugar * 23 batches = 23 cups
- 1 teaspoon salt * 23 batches = 23 teaspoons
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract * 23 batches = 23 teaspoons

Initial crayons: 479
Received from friends: +87
Bought for project: +39
Gave away: -128
Lost: -245

First, we add the crayons he received and bought to his initial amount:

49,"There are 144 cupcakes to be shared among 12 children. The cupcakes need to be distributed in a specific ratio of 3:2:1 among three groups. After allocating the cupcakes based on the ratio, how many cupcakes does each child get within their respective group, assuming they share equally?","First, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio. The ratio is 3:2:1, which means there are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 parts in total.

Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes each part represents. Since there are 144 cupcakes to be shared and 6 parts in the ratio, each part represents 144 / 6 = 24 cupcakes.

Now, we can allocate the cupcakes to each group based on the ratio:
- The first group gets 3 parts, so they get 3 * 24 = 72 cupcakes.
- The second group gets 2 parts, so they get 2 * 24 = 48 cupcakes.
- The third group gets 1 part, so they get 1 * 24 = 24 cupcakes.

Finally, we need to divide the cupcakes among the children in each group. Since there are 12 children, we can assume there are 4 children in each group (as 12 divided by 3 groups equals 4 children per group).

So, each child in the respective groups gets:
- First group: 72 cupcakes / 4 children = 18 cupcakes per child.
- Second group: 48 cupcakes / 4 children = 12 cupcakes per child.
- Third group: 24 cupcakes / 4 children = 6 cupcakes per child.","There are 4 cupcakes for each group. As there are 12 children, each child gets **one** cupcake.","First, let's find out how many cupcakes each group gets based on the ratio.

The ratio is 3:2:1, which means that for every 3 cupcakes, there are 2 more and 1 more. So, for every 6 cupcakes, there is 1 more.

Now, let's find out how many cupcakes each group gets by multiplying the ratio by the total number of cupcakes.

Group 1 (3:1) gets 3 times the number of cupcakes: 3 * 144 = 432 cupcakes
Group 2 (2:1) gets 2 times the number of cupcakes: 2 * 144 = 288 cupcakes
Group 3 (1:1) gets 1 times the number of cupcakes: 1 * 144 = 144 cupcakes

Now, let's find out how many cupcakes each child gets within their respective group.

Since there are 12 children, we divide the number of cupcakes in each group by 12 to find out how many cupcakes each child gets.

Group 1: 432 cupcakes ÷ 12 children = 36 cupcakes per child
Group 2: 288 cupcakes ÷ 12 children = 24 cupcakes per child
Group 3: 144 cupcakes ÷ 12 children = 12 cupcakes per child

So, each child in Group 1 gets 36 cupcakes, each child in Group 2 gets 24 cupcakes, and each child in Group 3 gets 12 cupcakes.",one,12 cupcakes,6 cupcakes

In the second match, Team Hawks played against Team Falcons where they scored 4 touchdowns, 3 field goals and Team Falcons scored 6 touchdowns and 2 safeties. Calculate the total points made by each team at the end of the two matches.","Let's calculate the points for each team one by one.

**Team Hawks:**
In the first match, Team Hawks scored:
- 3 touchdowns at 7 points each: 3 * 7 = 21 points
- 2 field goals at 3 points each: 2 * 3 = 6 points
- 1 safety at 2 points each: 1 * 2 = 2 points

So, in the first match, Team Hawks scored a total of: 21 + 6 + 2 = 29 points

In the second match, Team Hawks scored:
- 4 touchdowns at 7 points each: 4 * 7 = 28 points
- 3 field goals at 3 points each: 3 * 3 = 9 points

So, in the second match, Team Hawks scored a total of: 28 + 9 = 37 points

Total points for Team Hawks after two matches: 29 + 37 = 66 points

**Team Eagles:**
In the first match, Team Eagles scored:
- 5 touchdowns at 7 points each: 5 * 7 = 35 points
- 4 field goals at 3 points each: 4 * 3 = 12 points

So, in the first match, Team Eagles scored a total of: 35 + 12 = 47 points

Team Eagles did not play in the second match, so their total points after two matches remain: 47 points

**Team Falcons:**
Team Falcons only played in the second match, where they scored:
- 6 touchdowns at 7 points each: 6 * 7 = 42 points
- 2 safeties at 2 points each: 2 * 2 = 4 points

So, in the second match, Team Falcons scored a total of: 42 + 4 = 46 points

Since Team Falcons did not play in the first match, their total points after two matches are: 46 points

Martin walked at a speed of 3 miles per hour for the first 12 miles, then increased his speed to 4 miles per hour for the next 12 miles. Finally, he slowed down to 2 miles per hour for the last 12 miles of his journey. Calculate the average speed of Martin during his entire journey to Lawrence's house.","To calculate the average speed for the entire journey, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The total distance traveled by Martin is 36 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time taken for each part of the journey:

1. For the first 12 miles at 3 miles per hour:
Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 3 mph = 4 hours

2. For the next 12 miles at 4 miles per hour:
Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours

3. For the last 12 miles at 2 miles per hour:
Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours

Now, let's find the total time taken for the journey:
Total time = Time for first part + Time for second part + Time for third part
Total time = 4 hours + 3 hours + 6 hours = 13 hours

Finally, we calculate the average speed for the entire journey:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 36 miles / 13 hours ≈ 2.77 miles per hour

Martin's average speed during his entire journey to Lawrence's house is approximately 2.77 miles per hour.","Martin traveled at 3.2 miles per hour over the whole journey.

His total journey took 12 hours, as he walked 12 miles at 3 miles per hour (4 hours), then 12 miles at 4 miles per hour (3 hours), and finally 12 miles at 2 miles per hour (6 hours). Dividing the total distance, 36 miles, by the time gives us his average speed.

The total distance Martin traveled is 36 miles, because he started from his house and ended at Lawrence's house, which is 36 miles away.

Now, let's calculate the time he spent on each segment of his journey:

For the first 12 miles, he walked at 3 miles per hour, so the time taken is:
12 miles / 3 miles per hour = 4 hours

For the next 12 miles, he walked at 4 miles per hour, so the time taken is:
12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

For the last 12 miles, he walked at 2 miles per hour, so the time taken is:
12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Now, let's add up the total time taken for the entire journey:
4 hours (first 12 miles) + 3 hours (next 12 miles) + 6 hours (last 12 miles) = 13 hours

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 36 miles / 13 hours

He finds a coupon that offers a 5% discount on his total purchase before taxes. The tax rate is 8%. He has already saved $8 from his allowance. How much more money does Jonathan need to buy all five books, considering the discount and tax?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the books before the discount and tax:

Dictionary: $11
Dinosaur book: $19
Children's cookbook: $7
Atlas: $15
Set of picture books: $32

Total cost before discount and tax = $11 + $19 + $7 + $15 + $32 = $84

Now, let's calculate the discount Jonathan gets with the coupon:

Discount = 5% of $84 = 0.05 * $84 = $4.20

Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted total:

Discounted total = $84 - $4.20 = $79.80

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the discounted total:

Tax = 8% of $79.80 = 0.08 * $79.80 = $6.384

Since we usually don't deal with fractions of a cent, we'll round the tax to the nearest cent:

Tax = $6.38 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, let's add the tax to the discounted total to get the final amount Jonathan needs to pay:

Final amount = Discounted total + Tax = $79.80 + $6.38 = $86.18

Jonathan has already saved $8, so we need to subtract that from the final amount to find out how much more he needs:

Amount needed = Final amount - Amount saved = $86.18 - $8 = $78.18

Jonathan needs an additional $78.18 to buy all five books, considering the discount and tax.","Jonathan needs $55.36 more.

Here's the step-by-step solution:
1. Calculate the total cost of the books before the discount: $11 + $19 + $7 + $15 + $32 = $84.

2. Find the discount amount: 84 x 5% = $4.

3. Calculate the new total after the discount: $84 - $4 = $80.

4. Figure out the sales tax: $80 x 8% = $6.40.

5. Add the discounted price and tax: $80 + $6.40 = $86.40.

6. Determine how much money Jonathan has in total: $8 (saved allowance) + $5 (coupon) = $13.
7. Jonathan needs $86.40 - $13 = $55.36 more. 

$55.36","First, let's calculate the total cost of the books before the discount:

Dictionary: $11
Dinosaur book: $19
Children's cookbook: $7
Atlas: $15
Set of picture books: $32

Total cost before discount = $11 + $19 + $7 + $15 + $32 = $94

Now, let's apply the 5% discount to the total cost:

Discount = 5% of $94 = 0.05 * $94 = $4.70

So, the total cost after the discount is:

Total cost after discount = $94 - $4.70 = $89.30

Now, let's calculate the tax on the total cost after the discount:

Tax = 8% of $89.30 = 0.08 * $89.30 = $7.144

Since Jonathan has already saved $8 from his allowance, we need to add the tax to the total cost after the discount to find out how much more money he needs:

Total cost after tax = $89.30 + $7.144 = $96.444

- 5 nickels

After receiving coins from her parents, Melanie has:
- Dimes: 7 (initial) + 8 (dad) + 4 (mom) = 19 dimes
- Quarters: 3 (initial) + 2 (dad) = 5 quarters
- Nickels: 0 (initial) + 5 (mom) = 5 nickels

Then, Melanie spent:
- 2 quarters
- 10 dimes

After spending coins at the store, Melanie has:
- Dimes: 19 (after parents) - 10 (spent) = 9 dimes
- Quarters: 5 (after parents) - 2 (spent) = 3 quarters
- Nickels: 5 (after parents) - 0 (spent) = 5 nickels

So, Melanie now has 9 dimes, 5 nickels, and 3 quarters.","Melanie initially has 7 dimes + 3 quarters = 10 coins.

Her dad gives her 8 dimes + 2 quarters = 10 coins.
Her mom gives her 4 dimes (no nickels as they're irrelevant to the final answer) and this adds 4 dimes to Melanie's collection.

Melanie now has a total of 10 + 10 + 4 = 24 coins.

62,"Jane helped her mom prepare fresh mixed fruit lemonade. The recipe requires 2 lemons and 1 orange for each glass of lemonade. If they have 18 lemons and 10 oranges, how many glasses of fresh mixed fruit lemonade can Jane and her mom prepare? And if 1 grapefruit can replace 2 lemons and 1 orange, and they have 6 grapefruits, how many more glasses of lemonade can they make?","First, let's calculate how many glasses of lemonade they can make with the lemons and oranges they have.

Since each glass of lemonade requires 2 lemons, with 18 lemons, they can make 18 / 2 = 9 glasses of lemonade based on the lemons.

Since each glass of lemonade requires 1 orange, with 10 oranges, they can make 10 / 1 = 10 glasses of lemonade based on the oranges.

However, since each glass requires both 2 lemons and 1 orange, the limiting factor is the number of lemons, which allows for only 9 glasses of lemonade.

Now, let's calculate how many additional glasses of lemonade they can make with the grapefruits.

Each grapefruit can replace 2 lemons and 1 orange. Since they have 6 grapefruits, they can replace 6 * 2 = 12 lemons and 6 * 1 = 6 oranges.

With the grapefruits, they can make an additional 6 glasses of lemonade (since each grapefruit can be used for one glass of lemonade).

Therefore, in total, Jane and her mom can prepare 9 (from lemons and oranges) + 6 (from grapefruits) = 15 glasses of fresh mixed fruit lemonade.","First, we calculate how many glasses of lemonade can be made without the grapefruits:
2 lemons and 1 orange are needed for one glass, so with 18 lemons and 10 oranges, Jane and her mom can make 18 / 2 = 9 glasses. 

The ingredients left after preparing the 9 glasses are 10 lemons and 2 oranges. Now, we calculate how many glasses can be made with the help of the 6 grapefruits: 
Each grapefruit replaces 2 lemons and 1 orange, so they can 'create' 6 lemons from the grapefruits. With the remaining 10 lemons and 2 oranges plus the 6 lemons from the grapefruits, Jane and her mom have a total of 16 lemons and 4 oranges. This allows them to make another 16 / 2 = 8 glasses of lemonade. 

Therefore, the total number of glasses is Nine plus Eight equals Seventeen.

Seventeen glasses.","First, let's calculate how many glasses of lemonade they can make with the lemons and oranges they have.

They have 18 lemons and 10 oranges. According to the recipe, each glass of lemonade requires 2 lemons and 1 orange.

So, for each glass of lemonade, they need:
- 2 lemons
- 1 orange

Now, let's calculate how many glasses of lemonade they can make with the lemons and oranges they have:

Number of glasses of lemonade = (Number of lemons / 2) * (Number of oranges / 1)
Number of glasses of lemonade = (18 / 2) * (10 / 1)
Number of glasses of lemonade = 9 * 10
Number of glasses of lemonade = 90

Now, let's calculate how many more glasses of lemonade they can make with the grapefruits they have.

According to the recipe, 1 grapefruit can replace 2 lemons and 1 orange. So, for each grapefruit, they can make:
- 2 lemons worth of lemonade
- 1 orange worth of lemonade

Now, let's calculate how many more glasses of lemonade they can make with the grapefruits:

Number of more glasses of lemonade = (Number of grapefruits / 1) * (Number of lemons per grapefruit / 2) * (Number of oranges per grapefruit / 1)
Number of more glasses of lemonade = (6 / 1) * (2 / 2) * (1 / 1)
Number of more glasses of lemonade = 6 * 1 * 1
Number of more glasses of lemonade = 6

So, with the grapefruits, they can make 6 more glasses of lemonade.

In total, they can make 90 + 6 = 96 glasses of fresh mixed fruit lemonade.",Seventeen,ninety six,fifteen
63,"Joan found 79.5 seashells on the beach (yes, a whole shell was broken). She decided to give Mike 45% of the seashells she found. How many seashells does she have left after giving some to Mike?","First, we need to calculate how many seashells Joan gave to Mike. To do this, we take 45% of 79.5 seashells.

45% of 79.5 = 0.45 * 79.5 = 35.775

So, Joan gave Mike 35.775 seashells.

Now, to find out how many seashells Joan has left, we subtract the number of seashells she gave away from the total number she found.

0.45 * 79.5 = 35.775

Since Joan can't give a fraction of a seashell, we'll round this number to the nearest whole number. Since 35.775 is closer to 36 than to 35, we'll round up to 36.

Now, we know Joan gave Mike 36 seashells. To find out how many seashells she has left, we subtract the number of seashells she gave to Mike from the total number of seashells she found:

The person with the most crayons is Peter with 752 crayons.
The person with the least crayons is Rachel with 315 crayons.

Now, we subtract the number of crayons Rachel has from the number of crayons Peter has to find the difference:

There are 76 students in the three portions, and each portion has a different number of students given by the proportion: 2x : 3x : 4x. Each student in each portion receives the same number of candies. How many pieces of candy will each student get in each portion?","First, let's find the total ratio of the portions by adding the individual ratios: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of candy each portion gets based on the total ratio:
- The first portion gets (3/15) of the total candy.
- The second portion gets (5/15) of the total candy.
- The third portion gets (7/15) of the total candy.

Now, let's calculate the number of candies for each portion:
- First portion: (3/15) * 7,562 = 1,512.4 candies
- Second portion: (5/15) * 7,562 = 2,520.666... candies
- Third portion: (7/15) * 7,562 = 3,529.066... candies

Since we can't have a fraction of a candy, we'll round these numbers to the nearest whole number:
- First portion: 1,512 candies
- Second portion: 2,521 candies
- Third portion: 3,529 candies

Now, let's find the value of x in the proportion of students. We know there are 76 students in total, and they are divided as 2x, 3x, and 4x for each portion, respectively.

2x + 3x + 4x = 76
9x = 76
x = 76 / 9
x = 8.444...

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round x to the nearest whole number, which is 8.

Now, let's find the number of students in each portion:
- First portion: 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 students
- Second portion: 3x = 3 * 8 = 24 students
- Third portion: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32 students

Finally, let's calculate how many pieces of candy each student gets in each portion:
- First portion: 1,512 candies / 16 students = 94.5 candies per student
- Second portion: 2,521 candies / 24 students = 105.0416... candies per student
- Third portion: 3,529 candies / 32 students = 110.28125 candies per student

Since we can't have a fraction of a candy, we'll round these numbers to the nearest whole number:
- First portion: 95 candies per student
- Second portion: 105 candies per student
- Third portion: 110 candies per student

So, each student in the first portion will get 95 candies, each student in the second portion will get 105 candies, and each student in the third portion will get 110 candies.","We are trying to find out the number of candies each student gets, which is the same for every student. There are 76 students in total, divided into three portions in the ratio 2x: 3x: 4x. 

The total number of candies needs to be divided into three portions in the ratio 3:5:7. We can represent the total number of candies as 11x, where x is a whole number, since 7562 divided by 11 gives x = 687.5, which can be rounded down to 687 as the number of candies in the smallest portion. 

Each portion then contains 3x, 5x, and 7x candies, respectively. We know that the ratio of students in the second portion is 3x, which means that there are 76 / 6 students in this portion, giving us x = 12. 

This means that each portion contains 3 * 12 = 36, 5 * 12 = 60, and 7 * 12 = 84 candies, respectively. 

Since each student receives the same amount of candy, we have found our answer: each student gets 84 / 76 = 1.1 candies. 

**1.1**","First, let's find the total number of candies in each portion. Since the candies are divided into 3 portions at a ratio of 3:5:7, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of candies in each portion.

Let's denote the total number of candies in each portion as 3x, 5x, and 7x, respectively. The total number of candies is the sum of the candies in each portion, which is given by:

3x + 5x + 7x = 7,562

Now, let's solve for x:

15x = 7,562
x = 7,562 / 15
x = 504.1333...

Since we can't have a fraction of a candy, we'll round x to the nearest whole number. The nearest whole number that is less than 504.1333... is 504.

Now, let's find the total number of candies in each portion:

3x = 3 * 504 = 1,512
5x = 5 * 504 = 2,520
7x = 7 * 504 = 3,528

Now, let's find the number of candies per student in each portion. We know that each portion has a different number of students given by the proportion: 2x : 3x : 4x.

Let's denote the number of students in the first portion as 2x, the second portion as 3x, and the third portion as 4x.

However, they also needed to pay a sales tax of 8.25% on their meal, and wished to leave a tip. Sally wanted to tip 15%, Sam 18%, Alyssa 20%, Jack 22%, and Sarah was generous enough to leave a 25% tip. They decided to calculate the tip as a percent of the total cost of the meal (including tax). What was the total cost of the meal including tax and tip?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the meal before tax and tip. Since each person paid $90 and there are 5 people, the total cost before tax and tip is:

Total cost before tax and tip = $90 * 5 = $450

Now, let's calculate the sales tax:

Sales tax = 8.25% of $450
Sales tax = 0.0825 * $450
Sales tax = $37.125

We'll round the sales tax to the nearest cent, which gives us:

Sales tax ≈ $37.13

Now, let's add the sales tax to the total cost before tax and tip to get the total cost before tip:

Total cost before tip = $450 + $37.13
Total cost before tip = $487.13

Now, we need to calculate the average tip percentage. Since they want to calculate the tip as a percent of the total cost of the meal (including tax), we'll average the tip percentages:

Average tip percentage = (15% + 18% + 20% + 22% + 25%) / 5
Average tip percentage = (100% + 15% + 18% + 20% + 22% + 25%) / 5
Average tip percentage = 100%

Now, let's calculate the tip:

Tip = Average tip percentage of $487.13
Tip = 1.00 * $487.13
Tip = $487.13

Finally, let's add the tip to the total cost before tip to get the total cost of the meal including tax and tip:

Total cost including tax and tip = $487.13 + $487.13
Total cost including tax and tip = $974.26

Therefore, the total cost of the meal including tax and tip is $974.26.","To solve this problem, we need to find the pre-tax cost of the meal, which is $90 x 5 = $450. 

We then calculate the sales tax: $450 x 0.0825 = $37.13. 

The total with tax is $450 + $37.13 = $487.13. 

Now, we calculate the tip for each person: 
Sally: $487.13 x 0.15 = $73.07
Sam: $487.13 x 0.18 = $87.68
Alyssa: $487.13 x 0.2 = $97.43
Jack: $487.13 x 0.22 = $107.17
Sarah: $487.13 x 0.25 = $121.79

Adding these together, the total tip is $406.10. 

The final cost including tax and tip is $487.13 + $406.10 = $893.23.

$893.23.","First, let's calculate the total cost of the meal including tax for each person. Since each person paid $90 before tax, we need to add the sales tax of 8.25% to that amount.

For Sally:
$90 + (8.25% of $90) = $90 + ($90 * 0.0825) = $90 + $7.35 = $97.35

For Sam:
$90 + (8.25% of $90) = $90 + ($90 * 0.0825) = $90 + $7.35 = $97.35

For Alyssa:
$90 + (8.25% of $90) = $90 + ($90 * 0.0825) = $90 + $7.35 = $97.35

For Jack:
$90 + (8.25% of $90) = $90 + ($90 * 0.0825) = $90 + $7.35 = $97.35

For Sarah:
$90 + (8.25% of $90) = $90 + ($90 * 0.0825) = $90 + $7.35 = $97.35

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the meal including tax for the group:

Total cost including tax = Sally's cost + Sam's cost + Alyssa's cost + Jack's cost + Sarah's cost
Total cost including tax = $97.35 + $97.35 + $97.35 + $97.35 + $97.35 = $480

Next, we need to calculate the tip for each person based on the percentage they wanted to leave.

For Sally:
Tip = 15% of the total cost including tax
Tip = 0.15 * $480 = $72

For Sam:
Tip = 18% of the total cost including tax
Tip = 0.18 * $480 = $86.40

For Alyssa:
Tip = 20% of the total cost including tax
Tip = 0.20 * $480 = $96

For Jack:
Tip = 22% of the total cost including tax
Tip = 0.22 * $480 = $105.60

Black kittens left: 5
White kittens left: 4
Total kittens left: 5 (black) + 4 (white) = 9 kittens

Total black kittens: 5 (left) + 5 (given away) = 10 black kittens
Total white kittens: 4 (left) + 14 (given away) = 18 white kittens

Now, let's add them up to find the total price without the discount:

Total price without discount = $180.00 + $200.00 + $120.00 = $500.00

Since she is buying more than 25 packages (15 small + 10 medium + 4 large = 29 packages), she gets a 5% discount off the total price. Let's calculate the discount amount:

Discount amount = 5% of $500.00 = 0.05 * $500.00 = $25.00

Now, let's calculate the discounted total price:

Discounted total price = Total price without discount - Discount amount

According to the information given, we have the initial number of roses in the vase (6) plus the number of roses Mary cut (M) plus the number of roses Jane cut (J) equaling the new total number of roses in the vase (25).

So, the equation representing this situation is:

6 + M + J = 25

To find out how many roses each of them cut, we need more information to solve for M and J. As it stands, there are infinite combinations of M and J that could satisfy this equation. For example, if Mary cut 9 roses, then Jane would have cut 10 roses (6 + 9 + 10 = 25). If Mary cut 5 roses, then Jane would have cut 14 roses (6 + 5 + 14 = 25), and so on.

Without additional information, we cannot determine the exact number of roses each person cut.","Mary had 6 roses in the vase. Adding to that, both Mary and Jane cut some from their gardens and got a new total of 25 roses. We can determine that the sum of the roses they added is 25 - 6 = 19 roses. 

Since both of them contributed an equal number of roses, each of them cut 19 / 2 = 9.5 roses from their gardens.

9.5 roses.","Let's denote the number of roses Mary cut as M and the number of roses Jane cut as J.

Initially, Mary had 6 roses in the vase. After they added the new roses, the total became 25 roses. So, the number of new roses they added is:

25 - 6 = 19 roses

Since both Mary and Jane contributed to the new total, we can set up the following equation:

M + J = 19

We know that the total number of roses in the vase is 25, so we can write another equation:

6 + M + J = 25

Now we have two equations:

1) M + J = 19
2) 6 + M + J = 25

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of M and J.

From the first equation, we can express J in terms of M:

J = 19 - M

Now we substitute this expression for J into the second equation:

6 + M + (19 - M) = 25

Combine like terms:

6 + 2M + 19 = 25

Now, solve for M:

2M + 25 = 25
2M = 25 - 25
2M = 0
M = 0

Now that we know M = 0, we can find J using the first equation:

1. First concert: We are given that 65,899 people attended.

2. Second concert: It had 119 more people than the first concert.

3. Third concert: It had 5% fewer people than the first concert.
   To find 5% of 65,899, we calculate (5/100) * 65,899 = 3,294.95.
   Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 3,295.

The final result is: 125,424.","Let's denote the number of people at the first concert as \( x \).

According to the information given, the second concert had 119 more people than the first concert, so the number of people at the second concert is \( x + 119 \).

The third concert had 5% fewer people than the first concert, so the number of people at the third concert is \( 0.95x \).

The fourth concert had twice as many people as the third concert, so the number of people at the fourth concert is \( 2 \times 0.95x = 1.90x \).

We know that the total number of people who attended all four concerts is 65,899. So we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 119) + (0.95x) + (1.90x) = 65,899 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.85x + 119 = 65,899 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 3.85x = 65,899 - 119 \]
\[ 3.85x = 65,780 \]
\[ x = \frac{65,780}{3.85} \]
\[ x = 17,000 \]

82,"Adam has $5.00 to buy an airplane that costs $4.28. There is a 7% sales tax, and Adam has a 10% discount coupon. How much change will Adam get after the discount and sales tax are applied?","First, let's calculate the discount Adam gets with his coupon. The airplane costs $4.28, and he has a 10% discount.

Discount amount = 10% of $4.28
                 = 0.10 * $4.28
                 = $0.428

Now, let's subtract the discount from the original price to find the new price.

New price = Original price - Discount amount
          = $4.28 - $0.428
          = $3.852

Next, we need to calculate the sales tax on the new price. The sales tax is 7%.

Sales tax amount = 7% of $3.852
                 = 0.07 * $3.852
                 = $0.26964

Now, let's add the sales tax to the new price to find the total cost.

Total cost = New price + Sales tax amount
           = $3.852 + $0.26964
           = $4.12164

Since we can't have a fraction of a cent in currency, we'll round the total cost to the nearest cent.

Total cost (rounded) = $4.12

Now, let's find out how much change Adam will get from his $5.00.

Change = Amount Adam has - Total cost
       = $5.00 - $4.12
       = $0.88

Adam will get $0.88 in change after the discount and sales tax are applied.","Adam has a $0.72 discount with 10% off, bringing the price down to $3.56. After adding the 7% sales tax of $0.25, the total comes to $3.81. 

Adam will receive $1.19 in change.

One dollar nineteen cents.","First, let's calculate the total cost of the airplane before the discount and sales tax are applied.

Total cost before discount = Cost of airplane + Sales tax
Total cost before discount = $4.28 + (7% of $4.28)
Total cost before discount = $4.28 + (0.07 * $4.28)
Total cost before discount = $4.28 + $0.30216
Total cost before discount = $4.58216

Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the total cost before discount.

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - (10% of Total cost before discount)
Total cost after discount = $4.58216 - (0.10 * $4.58216)
Total cost after discount = $4.58216 - $0.458216
Total cost after discount = $4.12395

Now, let's calculate the change Adam will get after the discount and sales tax are applied.

Change = Total amount Adam has - Total cost after discount

If the average number of balls for all jugglers during the 5-minute performance is 6 balls, what is the minimum and maximum possible range of the total number of balls used throughout the performance considering their varying skill levels?","To find the minimum and maximum possible range of the total number of balls used, we need to calculate the total number of balls if all jugglers were juggling the minimum number of balls (4 balls each) and the maximum number of balls (8 balls each).

Minimum total number of balls:
If each of the 378 jugglers juggles the minimum of 4 balls, the total number of balls would be:
378 jugglers * 4 balls/juggler = 1512 balls

Maximum total number of balls:
If each of the 378 jugglers juggles the maximum of 8 balls, the total number of balls would be:
378 jugglers * 8 balls/juggler = 3024 balls

Therefore, the possible range of the total number of balls used throughout the performance is from 1512 to 3024 balls.","Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that there are 378 jugglers, and each juggler can manage between 4 and 8 balls at any given time. The average number of balls being juggled across all performers is 6.

The minimum number of balls would be when all 378 jugglers are only juggling the minimum of 4 balls each. This results in a total of 1,512 balls being used (378 jugglers * 4 balls each).

The maximum number of balls would be the case when each juggler manages the maximum of 8 balls. This equates to a substantial 3,024 balls in total (378 jugglers * 8 balls each).

The difference between the maximum and minimum possible number of balls gives us a range of 1,512 balls (3,024 balls - 1,512 balls). 

Balls: 1,512","Let's denote the minimum number of balls per juggler as \( B_{min} \) and the maximum number of balls per juggler as \( B_{max} \).

From the information given, we know that \( B_{min} = 4 \) and \( B_{max} = 8 \).

The average number of balls per juggler during the performance is 6, so we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{B_{min} + B_{max}}{2} = 6 \]

Substituting the values of \( B_{min} \) and \( B_{max} \) into the equation, we get:

\[ \frac{4 + 8}{2} = 6 \]

What is the minimum and maximum number of stickers a person can receive in this arrangement?","To solve this, we need to distribute the stickers in such a way that each person gets a different number of stickers and the total adds up to 72.

Let's start by giving the minimum number of stickers to each person, starting with 1 sticker for the first person, 2 for the second, and so on. This will ensure that each person gets a different number of stickers.

For the first 9 people, the distribution would be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 stickers. 

The sum of these numbers is:

Moreover, there is a 10% tax on books. Assuming all books cost the same and taxes are included in the price, how much did each book cost?","Let's denote the cost of each book before tax as \( x \) dollars.

Since Sam bought 3 series of books and each series has 8 books, he bought a total of \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) books.

After buying these books, he had 56 dollars left from his initial 200 dollars, which means he spent \( 200 - 56 = 144 \) dollars on the 24 books.

However, this amount includes a 10% tax. To find the cost before tax, we need to divide the total spent by 1.10 (since 10% tax means the total cost is 110% of the original price, or 1.10 times the original price).

So, the total cost before tax for the 24 books is \( \frac{144}{1.10} \).

Let's calculate that:

\( \frac{144}{1.10} = \frac{144}{\frac{11}{10}} = 144 \times \frac{10}{11} = \frac{1440}{11} \)

Now, we divide this amount by the number of books to find the cost of each book before tax:

\( \frac{1440}{11} \div 24 = \frac{1440}{11 \times 24} = \frac{1440}{264} \)

Let's calculate that:

\( \frac{1440}{264} = \frac{60}{11} \)

\( \frac{60}{11} \) dollars is the cost of each book before tax. Now, let's find the exact value:

\( \frac{60}{11} \approx 5.45 \)

So, each book cost approximately $5.45 before tax.","Sam had 200 - 56 = 144 dollars left after buying three series of books. 144 dollars would cover the cost of the fourth series and the 10% tax on all four series of books, as 144 / 0.9 = 160. 

Each book costs 160 / 32 = 5 dollars. 

$5.","Let's denote the cost of each book as \( x \).

Each series has 8 books, so the total cost for one series is \( 8x \).

Sam bought 3 series, so the total cost for the books is \( 3 \times 8x = 24x \).

After buying the books, Sam had only 56 dollars left. This means the total cost for the books was \( 200 - 56 = 144 \) dollars.

The tax is 10% of the cost, so the tax amount is \( 0.10 \times 144 = 14.40 \) dollars.

Since the tax is included in the price, we can subtract the tax amount from the total cost to find the cost of the books before tax: \( 144 - 14.40 = 129.60 \) dollars.

Now we have the total cost of the books before tax, which is \( 129.60 \) dollars, and we know that this cost is equal to \( 24x \).

To find the cost of each book, we divide the total cost by the number of books: \( 129.60 \div 24 = 5.40 \) dollars per book.

Sales tax for racing game = $0.27 (rounded from $0.27495)

Next, we add the sales tax to the price of each game to find the total cost for each game:

Total cost for basketball game = Price of the game + Sales tax
Total cost for basketball game = $5.20 + $0.34
Total cost for basketball game = $5.54

Total cost for racing game = Price of the game + Sales tax
Total cost for racing game = $4.23 + $0.27
Total cost for racing game = $4.50

Finally, we add the total costs of both games to find the total amount Joan spent on video games:

Total amount spent = Total cost for basketball game + Total cost for racing game
Total amount spent = $5.54 + $4.50
Total amount spent = $10.04

Joan spent $10.04 on video games, including the sales tax for each game.","Joan's total expenditure before tax: $5.20 + $4.23 = $9.43
Tax for the basketball game: $0.34 
Tax for the racing game: $0.27 

The taxes for both games combined: $0.61

Joan's total cost including tax: $10.04

$10.04.","To calculate the total amount Joan spent on the video games, including the sales tax for each game, we first need to calculate the sales tax for each game and then add that to the cost of the game.

For the basketball game:
Sales tax = 6.5% of $5.20
Sales tax = 0.065 * $5.20
Sales tax = $0.346

For the racing game:
Sales tax = 6.5% of $4.23
Sales tax = 0.065 * $4.23
Sales tax = $0.2751

Now, let's round the sales tax for the racing game to two decimal places:
Sales tax for racing game = $0.28

Next, we add the sales tax to the cost of each game:
Total for basketball game = $5.20 + $0.346
Total for basketball game = $5.546

Total for racing game = $4.23 + $0.28
Total for racing game = $4.51

Now, we add the total for both games to get the final amount:
Total amount = $5.546 (basketball game) + $4.51 (racing game)
Total amount = $10.056

Since we can't have a fraction of a cent, we'll round the total amount to the nearest cent:

97,"Kylie was collecting coins. She got 30 coins from her piggy bank and 26 coins from her brother. Her father gave Kylie twice as many coins as her brother, and she found 15 more coins underneath her sofa. Later that day, Kylie gave half of the coins to her friend Laura. How many coins did Kylie have left?","First, let's calculate the total number of coins Kylie collected from all sources:

From her piggy bank: 30 coins
From her brother: 26 coins
From her father (twice as many as her brother): 2 * 26 = 52 coins
Found under the sofa: 15 coins

Now, let's add all these together to find the total number of coins Kylie had before giving any to Laura:

Total coins = 30 (piggy bank) + 26 (brother) + 52 (father) + 15 (sofa)
Total coins = 30 + 26 + 52 + 15
Total coins = 56 + 52 + 15
Total coins = 108 + 15
Total coins = 123 coins

Kylie then gave half of her coins to Laura. To find out how many coins she gave to Laura, we divide the total number of coins by 2:

Coins given to Laura = 123 / 2
Coins given to Laura = 61.5

Since Kylie can't give half a coin, we'll assume she gave Laura 61 coins and kept the half coin for herself.

Now, let's subtract the number of coins Kylie gave to Laura from her total to find out how many coins she had left:

Coins left = Total coins - Coins given to Laura
Coins left = 123 - 61
Coins left = 62 coins

So, Kylie had 62 coins left after giving half to Laura.","Kylie started with 30 coins + 26 coins = 56 coins. Her father gave her 2 x 26 coins = 52 coins. Kylie then had 56 coins + 52 coins = 108 coins. After finding the coins under the sofa, Kylie had 108 coins + 15 coins = 123 coins. 
Kylie gave 123 coins / 2 = 61.5 coins to Laura.

Kylie had 123 - 61.5 coins = 61.5 coins left.

The final result is 61.5.","Let's calculate the number of coins Kylie had after each event:

1. She got 30 coins from her piggy bank.
2. She got 26 coins from her brother.
3. Her father gave her twice as many coins as her brother, so her father gave her 2 * 26 = 52 coins.
4. She found 15 more coins underneath her sofa, so she had 52 + 15 = 67 coins from her father.

Now, let's add up all the coins she had:

30 (from piggy bank) + 26 (from brother) + 67 (from father) = 123 coins.

Next, we need to find out how many coins she gave to Laura. Since she gave half of the coins to Laura, we divide the total number of coins by 2:

123 coins / 2 = 61.5 coins.

Since Kylie can't give half a coin, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 61 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Kylie had left:

123 coins (total) - 61 coins (given to Laura) = 62 coins left.

99,"At an offshore oil facility, there are four pipes that have started leaking oil into the sea over the course of a day. 

Pipe A leaked 6,522 liters before engineers started to fix it. While they worked, it further leaked 5,165 liters. 

Pipe B started leaking at a different time and leaked a total of 4,378 liters before engineers moved to repair it, and then another 3,250 liters leaked during their repair efforts. 

Pipe C had a smaller leak which leaked 2,897 liters over the first five hours, then the rate of leakage increased and another 7,562 liters were leaked over the next 10 hours. 

Pipe D started as a small leak but worsened over time: in the first 4 hours, it leaked 1,789 liters, then it leaked at double the rate for the next 2 hours and leaked 3,574 liters during that period. Finally, the engineers arrived to fix it, but during their work, it leaked an additional 5,110 liters. 

In all, how many liters of oil leaked into the water across these four pipes?","To find the total amount of oil leaked into the water, we need to sum up the amount leaked from each pipe before and during the repair.

For Pipe A:
Before repair: 6,522 liters
During repair: 5,165 liters
Total for Pipe A = 6,522 + 5,165 = 11,687 liters

For Pipe B:
Before repair: 4,378 liters
During repair: 3,250 liters
Total for Pipe B = 4,378 + 3,250 = 7,628 liters

For Pipe C:
Before repair: 2,897 liters
During repair: 7,562 liters

For Pipe D:
Before repair: 1,789 liters
During the increased rate: 3,574 liters
During repair: 5,110 liters
Total for Pipe D = 1,789 + 3,574 + 5,110 = 10,473 liters

Now, we add the totals for all pipes together:
Total oil leaked = Total for Pipe A + Total for Pipe B + Total for Pipe C + Total for Pipe D
Total oil leaked = 11,687 + 7,628 + 10,459 + 10,473
Total oil leaked = 40,247 liters

Therefore, a total of 40,247 liters of oil leaked into the water across these four pipes.","Let's calculate the total liters leaked across all four pipes.

Total liters leaked by Pipe A = 6,522 + 5,165 = 11,687 liters

For Pipe B:
- 4,378 liters leaked before engineers moved to repair it
- 3,250 liters leaked during their repair efforts

In all, how many passengers landed in Newberg last year, not counting the ones with cancelled flights?","To find the total number of passengers who landed in Newberg last year, not counting the ones with cancelled flights, we need to add the number of passengers who landed on time and the number of passengers who landed late at both airports.

At Airport A:
Passengers landed on time: 16,507
Passengers landed late: 256

At Airport B:
Passengers landed on time: 11,792
Passengers landed late: 135

Now, we add these numbers together:

Airport A on time + Airport A late + Airport B on time + Airport B late
= 16,507 + 256 + 11,792 + 135
= 16,763 (from Airport A) + 11,927 (from Airport B)

Airport B: 11,792 passengers landed on time + 135 passengers landed late = 11,927 passengers.

The total number of passengers who landed at Newberg's airports is the sum of the two amounts: 16,763 passengers + 11,927 passengers = 28,690 passengers.

Therefore, the final answer is twenty eight thousand six hundred ninety.","At Airport A, 16,507 passengers landed on time, 256 landed late, and 198 had their flights cancelled. So, the total number of passengers who landed at Airport A is:

101,"At her roadside fruit stand, Sally had 13 peaches, 20 apples, and 10 pears left. She wanted to maintain a ratio of 3:4:1 for peaches, apples, and pears respectively. Sally went to the orchard to pick more fruits to stock up the stand and maintain this ratio. When she got back, there were now 90 peaches, 120 apples, and 30 pears. How many peaches, apples, and pears did Sally pick during her trip to the orchard?","To find out how many of each fruit Sally picked, we need to subtract the number of fruits she had before from the number she had after her trip to the orchard.

Before her trip, Sally had:
- 13 peaches
- 20 apples
- 10 pears

After her trip, Sally had:
- 90 peaches
- 120 apples
- 30 pears

Now, let's calculate the difference for each type of fruit:

Peaches picked: 90 (after) - 13 (before) = 77 peaches
Apples picked: 120 (after) - 20 (before) = 100 apples
Pears picked: 30 (after) - 10 (before) = 20 pears

So, Sally picked 77 peaches, 100 apples, and 20 pears during her trip to the orchard.","To maintain the 3:4:1 ratio, Sally needs to have 48 fruits for the apples and 16 for the peaches and 8 for the pears. We can find the amount of fruits she picked by subtracting these numbers from the total amount of each fruit she has now:
90 peaches - 16 picked = 74
120 apples - 48 picked = 72
30 pears - 8 picked = 22

Sally picked a total of 74 + 72 + 22 = 168 fruits during her trip.

The final result is: One Hundred and Sixty-Eight.","To find out how many of each fruit Sally picked, we first need to calculate the ratio of each fruit to the total number of fruits.

The total number of fruits before Sally went to the orchard is:
13 peaches + 20 apples + 10 pears = 43 fruits

The total number of fruits after Sally went to the orchard is:
90 peaches + 120 apples + 30 pears = 240 fruits

Now, let's calculate the ratio of each fruit to the total number of fruits:

Peaches: 90 / 240 = 0.375
Apples: 120 / 240 = 0.5
Pears: 30 / 240 = 0.125

Sally wanted to maintain a ratio of 3:4:1 for peaches, apples, and pears respectively. To find out how many of each fruit she picked, we need to find the difference between the desired ratio and the actual ratio for each fruit.

For peaches:
Desired ratio = 3
Actual ratio = 0.375
Difference = 3 - 0.375 = 2.625

For apples:
Desired ratio = 4
Actual ratio = 0.5
Difference = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5

For pears:
Desired ratio = 1
Actual ratio = 0.125
Difference = 1 - 0.125 = 0.875

Now, let's calculate the number of each fruit Sally picked by multiplying the difference by the total number of fruits after she went to the orchard:

Peaches: 2.625 * 90 = 236.25
Apples: 3.5 * 120 = 420
Pears: 0.875 * 30 = 26.25

Since Sally can't pick a fraction of a fruit, we'll round the number of each fruit to the nearest whole number:

112,"A warehouse has 12,000 balls to be divided into bags for donating to children in foster homes. The balls will be distributed into 3 different types of bags: small, medium, and large. Small bags can hold 10 balls, medium bags can hold 25 balls, and large bags can hold 40 balls. If they want to make sure to use an equal number of each type of bag, how many of each type of bag will be used in the distribution?","Let's denote the number of each type of bag as \( x \).

Since each small bag holds 10 balls, the total number of balls in small bags will be \( 10x \).
For medium bags, which hold 25 balls each, the total will be \( 25x \).
For large bags, which hold 40 balls each, the total will be \( 40x \).

The total number of balls in all the bags will be the sum of the balls in the small, medium, and large bags, which is:
\[ 10x + 25x + 40x = 75x \]

We know that the total number of balls is 12,000, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 75x = 12,000 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 75:
\[ x = \frac{12,000}{75} \]
\[ x = 160 \]

So, \( x = 160 \), which means 160 of each type of bag will be used.

Therefore, there will be 160 small bags, 160 medium bags, and 160 large bags used in the distribution.","To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of balls (12,000) evenly among the three bag sizes. 

We notice that the least number of balls that can fit in bags are in the small bag size, which is 10 balls. Therefore, we can start by dividing 12,000 by 10 to find the number of small bags needed. 

12,000 / 10 = 1200 small bags

Now, we must determine how many medium and large bags are needed. Since 1200 small bags have been accounted for, we will now divide the remaining number of balls by the capacity of the medium and large bags.

Remaining balls after small bags = 12,000 - (10 x 1200) = 4,800 balls

4,800 / 25 = 192 medium bags

Remaining balls after medium bags = 4,800 - (25 x 192) = 300 balls

300 / 40 = 7 large bags

Adding the number of each type of bag gives us: 1200 + 192 + 7 = **1409** bags in total.

Twelve hundred small bags, one hundred and ninety-two medium bags, and seven large bags will be used in the distribution.

The final result is 1409.","To distribute the balls into an equal number of each type of bag, we need to find the greatest number of balls that can be held by one type of bag. This is because we want to use the same number of each type of bag, and we can only use whole numbers of bags.

The greatest number of balls that can be held by one type of bag is 40, which is the capacity of a large bag.

Now, we need to find out how many large bags we can fill with the 12,000 balls. To do this, we divide the total number of balls by the number of balls one large bag can hold:

12,000 ÷ 40 = 300

So, we can fill 300 large bags with the 12,000 balls.

Now, we need to find out how many small and medium bags we can fill with the remaining balls after using the large bags.

First, we subtract the number of balls used in the large bags from the total number of balls:

12,000 - 300 * 40 = 12,000 - 12,000 = 0

Since we have used all the balls in the large bags, we have no balls left to distribute into small and medium bags. Therefore, we will use 300 of each type of bag to distribute the balls.",1409,300,160

Mary bought 3 pounds of berries, 6.5 pounds of apples, and 4 pounds of peaches. Calculate the total amount of money Mary spent on these fruits.","To calculate the total amount of money Mary spent on the fruits, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of fruit by its respective price per pound and then sum up the totals.

For berries:
3 pounds * $3.66 per pound = $10.98

For apples:
6.5 pounds * $1.89 per pound = $12.285

For peaches:
4 pounds * $2.45 per pound = $9.80

Now, we add up the totals for each fruit to get the overall total amount spent:
$10.98 (berries) + $12.285 (apples) + $9.80 (peaches) = $33.065

114,"Last week, a restaurant sold different types of food, including hamburgers, hotdogs, and sandwiches. Given the following sales data for each day, what was the average daily hamburger sales rate, weighted by each day's total food sales?

Monday: 15 hamburgers, 10 hotdogs, and 10 sandwiches
Tuesday: 17 hamburgers, 13 hotdogs, and 20 sandwiches
Wednesday: 22 hamburgers, 18 hotdogs, and 15 sandwiches
Thursday: 25 hamburgers, 12 hotdogs, and 21 sandwiches
Friday: 17 hamburgers, 20 hotdogs, and 24 sandwiches
Saturday: 20 hamburgers, 30 hotdogs, and 25 sandwiches
Sunday: 14 hamburgers, 10 hotdogs, and 20 sandwiches","To calculate the weighted average daily hamburger sales rate, we need to first find the total number of hamburgers sold and the total number of all food items sold for each day. Then, we will use these numbers to find the weighted average.

Here's the breakdown for each day:

Monday:
Total hamburgers = 15
Total food items = 15 (hamburgers) + 10 (hotdogs) + 10 (sandwiches) = 35

Tuesday:
Total hamburgers = 17
Total food items = 17 (hamburgers) + 13 (hotdogs) + 20 (sandwiches) = 50

Wednesday:
Total hamburgers = 22
Total food items = 22 (hamburgers) + 18 (hotdogs) + 15 (sandwiches) = 55

Thursday:
Total hamburgers = 25
Total food items = 25 (hamburgers) + 12 (hotdogs) + 21 (sandwiches) = 58

Friday:
Total hamburgers = 17
Total food items = 17 (hamburgers) + 20 (hotdogs) + 24 (sandwiches) = 61

Saturday:
Total hamburgers = 20
Total food items = 20 (hamburgers) + 30 (hotdogs) + 25 (sandwiches) = 75

Sunday:
Total hamburgers = 14
Total food items = 14 (hamburgers) + 10 (hotdogs) + 20 (sandwiches) = 44

Now, we calculate the weighted average:

Weighted average = (Sum of (hamburgers sold * total food items sold on the same day)) / (Sum of total food items sold for all days)

Weighted average = [(15 * 35) + (17 * 50) + (22 * 55) + (25 * 58) + (17 * 61) + (20 * 75) + (14 * 44)] / (35 + 50 + 55 + 58 + 61 + 75 + 44)

Weighted average = (525 + 850 + 1210 + 1450 + 1037 + 1500 + 616) / (378)

Weighted average = (7188) / (378)

Weighted average ≈ 19.01

The weighted average daily hamburger sales rate is approximately 19.01 hamburgers per day.","To solve this, we need to calculate the total hamburger sales and total food sales for each day, and then find the weighted average daily rate.

Step 1: Calculate daily hamburger sales and total food sales:

Monday: Hamburgers sold = 15, Total food sales = 15 + 10 + 10 = 35
Tuesday: Hamburgers sold = 17, Total food sales = 17 + 13 + 20 = 50
Wednesday: Hamburgers sold = 22, Total food sales = 22 + 18 + 15 = 55
Thursday: Hamburgers sold = 25, Total food sales = 25 + 12 + 21 = 58
Friday: Hamburgers sold = 17, Total food sales = 17 + 20 + 24 = 61
Saturday: Hamburgers sold = 20, Total food sales = 20 + 30 + 25 = 75
Sunday: Hamburgers sold = 14, Total food sales = 14 + 10 + 20 = 44

Step 2: Calculate the weighted average daily hamburger sales rate:

Average Rate = {((Monday hamburgers sold) x (Total food sales on Monday)) + ... + (Sunday hamburgers sold) x (Total food sales on Sunday)} / (Total food sales on Monday + ... + Total food sales on Sunday)

Average Rate = ((15 x 35) + (17 x 50) + (22 x 55) + (25 x 58) + (17 x 61) + (20 x 75) + (14 x 44))/ (35 + 50 + 55 + 58 + 61 + 75 + 44)
Average Rate = 329/364 = 0.898351593406593

Hamburgers","To find the average daily hamburger sales rate, weighted by each day's total food sales, we first need to calculate the total food sales for each day. Then, we'll calculate the total hamburger sales for each day. Finally, we'll divide the total hamburger sales by the total food sales for each day to get the average daily hamburger sales rate.

Let's start by calculating the total food sales for each day:

Monday: 15 hamburgers + 10 hotdogs + 10 sandwiches = 35 total food sales
Tuesday: 17 hamburgers + 13 hotdogs + 20 sandwiches = 50 total food sales
Wednesday: 22 hamburgers + 18 hotdogs + 15 sandwiches = 55 total food sales
Thursday: 25 hamburgers + 12 hotdogs + 21 sandwiches = 60 total food sales
Friday: 17 hamburgers + 20 hotdogs + 24 sandwiches = 61 total food sales
Saturday: 20 hamburgers + 30 hotdogs + 25 sandwiches = 75 total food sales
Sunday: 14 hamburgers + 10 hotdogs + 20 sandwiches = 44 total food sales

Now, let's calculate the total hamburger sales for each day:

Monday: 15 hamburgers
Tuesday: 17 hamburgers
Wednesday: 22 hamburgers
Thursday: 25 hamburgers
Friday: 17 hamburgers
Saturday: 20 hamburgers
Sunday: 14 hamburgers

Now, we'll divide the total hamburger sales by the total food sales for each day to get the average daily hamburger sales rate:

Monday: 15 hamburgers / 35 total food sales = 0.4286 (average daily hamburger sales rate)
Tuesday: 17 hamburgers / 50 total food sales = 0.34 (average daily hamburger sales rate)
Wednesday: 22 hamburgers / 55 total food sales = 0.4 (average daily hamburger sales rate)
Thursday: 25 hamburgers / 60 total food sales = 0.4167 (average daily hamburger sales rate)
Friday: 17 hamburgers / 61 total food sales = 0.279 (average daily hamburger sales rate)
Saturday: 20 hamburgers / 75 total food sales = 0.2667 (average daily hamburger sales rate)

- Fred has F crayons.
- Benny has B crayons.
- Jason has J crayons.
- Sarah has S crayons.

From the information given, we know that:
1. The total number of crayons is 96: F + B + J + S = 96
2. Fred has 2 times as many crayons as Benny: F = 2B
3. Jason has 3 times as many crayons as Sarah: J = 3S
4. Benny has 12 crayons: B = 12

Now we can use these equations to find out how many crayons each person has.

Since Benny has 12 crayons, we can substitute B with 12 in the equation for Fred:
F = 2B
F = 2 * 12
F = 24

Now we have the number of crayons Fred has. Let's substitute the values of F and B into the total equation to find out how many crayons Jason and Sarah have together:
F + B + J + S = 96
24 + 12 + J + S = 96
36 + J + S = 96

Now we need to find J and S. Since we don't have direct numbers for Jason and Sarah, we can't solve for them individually yet. However, we know the relationship between J and S:
J = 3S

Let's express J in terms of S and substitute it into the equation:
36 + 3S + S = 96
36 + 4S = 96

Now we solve for S:
4S = 96 - 36
4S = 60
S = 60 / 4
S = 15

Now that we know Sarah has 15 crayons, we can find out how many crayons Jason has:
J = 3S

So, the number of crayons each person has is as follows:
- Fred has 24 crayons.
- Benny has 12 crayons.

2. Sarah has a third of Jason's crayons, so Sarah has 12 crayons too.

3. Therefore, Jason has 12 x 3 = 36 crayons.

4. Adding up all the crayons gives a total of 12 + 24 + 36 + 24 = 96 crayons. 

Ninety-six.","Let's denote the number of crayons each person has as follows:

2. Jason has 3 times as many crayons as Sarah, so J = 3S.
3. The total number of crayons is 96, so F + B + J + S = 96.

We know that Benny has 12 crayons, so we can substitute B = 12 into the first equation:

F = 2B = 2 * 12 = 24

Now we can substitute F = 24 into the total crayons equation:

24 + 12 + J + S = 96

We know that Jason has 3 times as many crayons as Sarah, so we can express J in terms of S:

J = 3S

Now we can substitute J = 3S into the total crayons equation:

24 + 12 + 3S + S = 96

Combine like terms:

24 + 12 + 4S = 96

S = 60 / 4
S = 15

Calculate the number of bathing suits available for each style (A, B, C, X, and Y) and then determine the overall percentage distribution for all bathing suit styles.","First, let's calculate the number of bathing suits available for each style for men and women.

For men's bathing suits:
- Style A: 40% of 14,797 = 0.40 * 14,797 = 5,918.8, which we round to 5,919
- Style B: 35% of 14,797 = 0.35 * 14,797 = 5,178.95, which we round to 5,179
- Style C: 25% of 14,797 = 0.25 * 14,797 = 3,699.25, which we round to 3,699

For women's bathing suits:
- Style X: 55% of 4,969 = 0.55 * 4,969 = 2,732.95, which we round to 2,733
- Style Y: 45% of 4,969 = 0.45 * 4,969 = 2,236.05, which we round to 2,236

Now, let's calculate the overall percentage distribution for all bathing suit styles. First, we need to find the total number of bathing suits for both men and women:

Total bathing suits = 14,797 (men) + 4,969 (women) = 19,766

Now, we calculate the overall percentage for each style:

- Style A: 5,919 / 19,766 = 0.2993 or 29.93%
- Style B: 5,179 / 19,766 = 0.2620 or 26.20%
- Style C: 3,699 / 19,766 = 0.1871 or 18.71%
- Style X: 2,733 / 19,766 = 0.1382 or 13.82%
- Style Y: 2,236 / 19,766 = 0.1131 or 11.31%

To summarize, the number of bathing suits available for each style and their overall percentage distribution are as follows:

- Style A: 5,919 bathing suits (29.93%)
- Style B: 5,179 bathing suits (26.20%)
- Style C: 3,699 bathing suits (18.71%)
- Style X: 2,733 bathing suits (13.82%)
- Style Y: 2,236 bathing suits (11.31%)","Here are the steps to solve the math problem:

1. First, we need to find the numbers of men's and women's bathing suits. For men's suits, we multiply the total number by each style percentage: 14,797 x 40% = 5,919 for style A; 14,797 x 35% = 5,179 for style B; and 14,797 x 25% = 3,699 for style C.

2. For women's suits, we calculate 4,969 x 55% = 2,733 for style X and 4,969 x 45% = 2,236 for style Y.

3. Now, we add the suits for each style to get the total: Style A - 5,919, Style B - 5,179, Style C - 3,699, Style X - 2,733, and Style Y - 2,236. The total number of bathing suits is 17,737.

4. To get the overall percentage distribution, we divide each style's count by the total number and multiply by 100: Style A - 33.41%, Style B - 29.21%, Style C - 20.89%, Style X - 15.38%, and Style Y - 12.61%.

The final result: 17,737%. 











Or, expressed as a single word: Seventeen Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty-Seven Percent.","First, let's calculate the number of bathing suits available for each style:

For men's bathing suits:
- Style A: 40% of 14,797 = 0.40 * 14,797 = 5,918.80
- Style B: 35% of 14,797 = 0.35 * 14,797 = 5,179.00
- Style C: 25% of 14,797 = 0.25 * 14,797 = 3,699.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a bathing suit, we'll round these numbers to the nearest whole number:
- Style A: 5,919
- Style B: 5,180
- Style C: 3,699

For women's bathing suits:
- Style X: 55% of 4,969 = 0.55 * 4,969 = 2,732.95
- Style Y: 45% of 4,969 = 0.45 * 4,969 = 2,236.05

Again, we'll round these numbers to the nearest whole number:
- Style X: 2,733
- Style Y: 2,236

Now, let's calculate the overall percentage distribution for all bathing suit styles:

For men's bathing suits:
- Style A: 5,919 / (5,919 + 5,180 + 3,699) * 100% = 5,919 / 14,798 * 100% ≈ 39.99%
- Style B: 5,180 / (5,919 + 5,180 + 3,699) * 100% = 5,180 / 14,798 * 100% ≈ 35.00%
- Style C: 3,699 / (5,919 + 5,180 + 3,699) * 100% = 3,699 / 14,798 * 100% ≈ 24.99%

For women's bathing suits:
- Style X: 2,733 / (2,733 + 2,236) * 100% = 2,",Seventeen Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty-Seven,two,29.93 26.20 18.71 13.82 11.31
119,"Sandy went to a sports store to buy various toys. She bought a football for $9.14, a baseball for $6.81, a jump rope for $3.55, and a frisbee for $2.50. There was a sale going on, and she got a discount of 15% on the jump rope and 10% on the frisbee. She paid for her purchases with a $20 bill, three $1 coins, and one 50-cent coin. How much change did she receive after the purchase?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discounts:

Football: $9.14
Baseball: $6.81
Jump rope: $3.55
Frisbee: $2.50

Total before discounts = $9.14 + $6.81 + $3.55 + $2.50 = $22.00

Now, let's calculate the discounts:

Jump rope discount (15% of $3.55) = 0.15 * $3.55 = $0.5325
Frisbee discount (10% of $2.50) = 0.10 * $2.50 = $0.25

Total discounts = $0.5325 + $0.25 = $0.7825

Now, let's subtract the discounts from the total before discounts to get the total after discounts:

Total after discounts = $22.00 - $0.7825 = $21.2175

Since we can't pay with fractions of a cent, we round the total to the nearest cent, which is $21.22.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Sandy paid with:

$20 bill + three $1 coins + one 50-cent coin = $20 + $3 + $0.50 = $23.50

Finally, let's calculate the change Sandy received:

Change = Amount paid - Total after discounts = $23.50 - $21.22 = $2.28

Sandy received $2.28 in change after her purchase.","Sandy's total spending before discounts is $9.14 + $6.81 + $3.55 + $2.50 = $22.40.
The discounts amount to $3.55 * 0.15 = $0.5325 and $2.50 * 0.10 = $0.25.
So the discounted price is $22.40 - $0.5325 - $0.25 = $21.6175.
With her $20 note, $3 in $1 coins, and a 50-cent coin, Sandy paid a total of $20 + $3 + $0.50 = $23.50.
Her change is therefore $23.50 - $21.6175 = $1.8825.
The change Sandy received is one dollar and eighty-eight cents ($1.88).","First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discounts:

Football: $9.14
Baseball: $6.81
Jump rope: $3.55
Frisbee: $2.50

Total cost before discounts = $9.14 + $6.81 + $3.55 + $2.50 = $21.90

Now, let's apply the discounts:

Discount on jump rope (15% of $3.55): 0.15 * $3.55 = $0.5325
Discount on frisbee (10% of $2.50): 0.10 * $2.50 = $0.25

Total discount = $0.5325 + $0.25 = $0.7825

Now, let's subtract the discounts from the total cost:

Total cost after discounts = $21.90 - $0.7825 = $21.1175

Next, let's calculate the total amount Sandy paid:

Total amount paid = $20 (the $20 bill) + $3 (the three $1 coins) + $0.50 (the 50-cent coin) = $23.50

Finally, let's calculate the change Sandy received:

Change = Total amount paid - Total cost after discounts
Change = $23.50 - $21.1175 = $2.3825

Sandy received $2.3825 in change.",1.88,2.3825,2.28
120,"Mrs. Hilt is baking two types of bread: whole wheat and rye bread. For 3 loaves of whole wheat bread, she needs 5 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour. For 2 loaves of rye bread, she needs 750 grams of rye flour. If she plans to bake equal numbers of both types of bread, how many cups of whole wheat flour and how many grams of rye flour will she need to make one loaf of each type of bread? Remember to convert the whole wheat flour measurements to grams, assuming 1 cup of flour weighs 140 grams.","First, let's find out how much whole wheat flour Mrs. Hilt needs for one loaf of whole wheat bread. Since 3 loaves require 5 1/2 cups, we divide 5 1/2 cups by 3 to find the amount needed for one loaf:

5 1/2 cups / 3 = 11/2 cups / 3 = 11/6 cups per loaf of whole wheat bread

Now, let's convert the cups of whole wheat flour to grams. We know that 1 cup of flour weighs 140 grams, so:

11/6 cups * 140 grams/cup = 11/6 * 140 = 11 * 140 / 6 = 1540 / 6 = 256.67 grams (rounded to two decimal places)

So, for one loaf of whole wheat bread, Mrs. Hilt needs approximately 256.67 grams of whole wheat flour.

Next, let's find out how much rye flour she needs for one loaf of rye bread. Since 2 loaves require 750 grams, we divide 750 grams by 2 to find the amount needed for one loaf:

750 grams / 2 = 375 grams per loaf of rye bread

Therefore, to make one loaf of each type of bread, Mrs. Hilt will need approximately 256.67 grams of whole wheat flour and 375 grams of rye flour.","Mrs. Hilt needs 280 grams of whole wheat flour and 375 grams of rye flour to bake one loaf of each type of bread.

The final result is 280 = 375.","First, let's convert the whole wheat flour measurements to grams. Since 1 cup of flour weighs 140 grams, we can calculate the weight of the whole wheat flour needed for 3 loaves of whole wheat bread:

5 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour * 140 grams/cup = 735 grams

Now, let's find out how many grams of rye flour Mrs. Hilt needs for one loaf of rye bread:

750 grams of rye flour / 2 loaves of rye bread = 375 grams of rye flour per loaf

Since Mrs. Hilt plans to bake equal numbers of both types of bread, she will need the same amount of flour for one loaf of each type. Therefore, for one loaf of whole wheat bread, she will need:

735 grams of whole wheat flour / 3 loaves of whole wheat bread = 245 grams of whole wheat flour per loaf

For one loaf of rye bread, she will need:

375 grams of rye flour per loaf

So, for one loaf of each type of bread, Mrs. Hilt will need 245 grams of whole wheat flour and 375 grams of rye flour.",280,245 375,256.67 375

If the 10 of them ate an equal number of pieces of cinnamon swirls, how many pieces did Jane eat?","If there were 120 pieces of bite-size cinnamon swirls and 10 people ate an equal number of pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of people to find out how many pieces each person ate.

120 pieces ÷ 10 people = 12 pieces per person

So, Jane ate 12 pieces of cinnamon swirls.","To determine the number of cinnamon swirl pieces Jane consumed, we divide the total amount by the number of people sharing them. Here's how the calculation works:

120 pieces of cinnamon swirls / 10 people = 12 pieces per person

Jane, therefore, enjoyed 12 pieces. 

Twelve.","If 10 people ate an equal number of pieces of cinnamon swirls, then each of them ate 120 pieces / 10 people = 12 pieces.

122,"The farmer has a large farm being attacked by aphids. To tackle this, he releases ladybugs onto the fields. There are initially 12,170 ladybugs with spots and 54,912 ladybugs without spots. The spotted ladybugs reproduce at a rate of 5% every week whereas the ladybugs without spots reproduce at 4% every week. How many ladybugs (spotted and non-spotted) are there on the farm after 12 weeks?","To calculate the number of ladybugs after 12 weeks, we need to apply the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for population growth:

Final Population = Initial Population * (1 + Growth Rate) ^ Number of Periods

Let's calculate the final population for both spotted and non-spotted ladybugs separately.

For spotted ladybugs:
Initial Population = 12,170
Growth Rate = 5% per week = 0.05
Number of Weeks = 12

Final Population of Spotted Ladybugs = 12,170 * (1 + 0.05) ^ 12

For non-spotted ladybugs:
Initial Population = 54,912
Growth Rate = 4% per week = 0.04
Number of Weeks = 12

Final Population of Non-Spotted Ladybugs = 54,912 * (1 + 0.04) ^ 12

Now, let's calculate the final populations:

Final Population of Spotted Ladybugs = 12,170 * (1.05) ^ 12
Final Population of Spotted Ladybugs = 12,170 * 1.79585632602213 (using a calculator)
Final Population of Spotted Ladybugs ≈ 21,863

Final Population of Non-Spotted Ladybugs = 54,912 * (1.04) ^ 12
Final Population of Non-Spotted Ladybugs = 54,912 * 1.60103221817432 (using a calculator)
Final Population of Non-Spotted Ladybugs ≈ 87,897

Now, we add the two populations to get the total number of ladybugs on the farm after 12 weeks:

Total Ladybugs = Final Population of Spotted Ladybugs + Final Population of Non-Spotted Ladybugs
Total Ladybugs ≈ 21,863 + 87,897
Total Ladybugs ≈ 109,760

Therefore, there are approximately 109,760 ladybugs on the farm after 12 weeks.","We have 12,170 spotted ladybugs and 54,912 spotless ladybugs at the beginning.
We calculate the number of new spotted ladybugs born each week by taking 5% of the current total: 12,170 ladybugs × 5% = 608.5 new ladybugs. We round this number up to the nearest whole number because ladybugs cannot be born half. 
Similarly, the number of new ladybugs without spots born each week is: 54,912 ladybugs × 4% = 2196.48 ladybugs, rounded up to 2197.

After the first week, we have a total of 12,778 spotted ladybugs and 57,109 ladybugs without spots.

We repeat this process for the following 11 weeks, adding the appropriate number of new ladybugs each week.

After 12 weeks, there are a total of 14,538 spotted ladybugs and 64,111 ladybugs without spots, which gives us a grand total of **98,649** ladybugs on the farm.","First, let's calculate the number of ladybugs with spots and without spots after 12 weeks.

For the ladybugs with spots:
- They reproduce at 5% every week.
- So, after 1 week, they will have 105% of their initial number.
- After 2 weeks, they will have 110% of their initial number.
- After 3 weeks, they will have 115% of their initial number.
- This pattern continues for each week.

Let's calculate the number of ladybugs with spots after 12 weeks:

After 1 week: 12,170 ladybugs with spots * 105% = 12,828.5 ladybugs with spots
After 2 weeks: 12,828.5 ladybugs with spots * 110% = 14,111.35 ladybugs with spots
After 3 weeks: 14,111.35 ladybugs with spots * 115% = 16,228.1 ladybugs with spots
After 4 weeks: 16,228.1 ladybugs with spots * 120% = 19,473.72 ladybugs with spots
After 5 weeks: 19,473.72 ladybugs with spots * 125% = 24,340.46 ladybugs with spots
After 6 weeks: 24,340.46 ladybugs with spots * 130% = 31,642.6 ladybugs with spots
After 7 weeks: 31,642.6 ladybugs with spots * 135% = 42,696.09 ladybugs with spots
After 8 weeks: 42,696.09 ladybugs with spots * 140% = 60,004.52 ladybugs with spots

For Nancy:
540 cards / 18.5 cards per pack = 29.19 packs
Since you can't have a fraction of a pack, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, so Nancy has 29 packs.

For Melanie:
620 cards / 22.5 cards per pack = 27.56 packs

For Mary:
480 cards / 15.3 cards per pack = 31.37 packs
Rounding down, Mary has 31 packs.

For Alyssa:
720 cards / 24 cards per pack = 30 packs
Alyssa has 30 packs (no rounding needed since it's a whole number).

On the first day, Paco ate 15 cookies, so the number of cookies left after Paco ate is:
93 - 15 = 78 cookies

Then, Maria ate 2/3 of the remaining cookies. To find out how many cookies Maria ate, we calculate:
2/3 * 78 = 52 cookies

So, after Maria ate, the number of cookies left is:
78 - 52 = 26 cookies

On the second day, Paco ate 10% of the remaining cookies. To find out how many cookies Paco ate on the second day, we calculate:
10% of 26 = 0.10 * 26 = 2.6 cookies

Since Paco can't eat a fraction of a cookie, we'll assume he ate either 2 or 3 cookies. However, typically in such calculations, we would round to the nearest whole number. In this case, we would round down because you can't eat a partial cookie. So, Paco ate 2 cookies on the second day.

1. The park currently has 2 rose bushes.
2. The workers plan to plant 4 more rose bushes, but the planting rate is three times more. This means they will actually plant 4 * 3 = 12 rose bushes.
3. After planting 12 more rose bushes, the total number of rose bushes in the park will be 2 (current) + 12 (planted) = 14 rose bushes.
4. However, some gardeners have to remove 5 rose bushes due to adverse weather conditions. So, after removing 5 rose bushes, the total number of rose bushes will be 14 (after planting) - 5 (removed) = 9 rose bushes.

If Mrs. Hilt goes to the water fountain 4 times a day, how many feet will she walk on her trips to the fountain in one week?","To find out how many feet Mrs. Hilt will walk in one week, we need to calculate the total distance she walks each day and then sum it up for the week.

On Monday, the distance is 30 feet, and she goes 4 times a day, so she walks:
30 feet x 4 trips = 120 feet

On Tuesday, the distance is 32 feet, and she goes 4 times a day, so she walks:
32 feet x 4 trips = 128 feet

On Wednesday, the distance is 28 feet, and she goes 4 times a day, so she walks:
28 feet x 4 trips = 112 feet

On Thursday, the distance is 35 feet, and she goes 4 times a day, so she walks:
35 feet x 4 trips = 140 feet

From Friday onwards, the distance remains constant at 30 feet. So for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she walks the same distance each day as she did on Monday:
30 feet x 4 trips = 120 feet per day

For these three days, she walks:
120 feet/day x 3 days = 360 feet

Monday: 120 feet
Tuesday: 128 feet
Wednesday: 112 feet
Thursday: 140 feet
Friday to Sunday: 360 feet

Total feet walked in one week:

Next, let's find the average number of each type of fruit picked by a person. Since there are two people (Alyssa and Nancy), we will divide the total number of each type of fruit by 2:

Average pears per person = Total pears / 2
Average pears per person = 805 / 2
Average pears per person = 402.5

Average apples per person = Total apples / 2
Average apples per person = 359 / 2
Average apples per person = 179.5

Average oranges per person = Total oranges / 2
Average oranges per person = 351 / 2
Average oranges per person = 175.5

So, the average number of pears picked by a person is 402.5, the average number of apples is 179.5, and the average number of oranges is 175.5.","Alyssa picked 854 fruits in total (378 + 225 + 149), while Nancy picked 963 fruits (427 + 134 + 202). Adding both together, we get a total of 1817 fruits. 

Dividing this number by the combined count of both pickers gives us an average of 454.25 fruits per person.

The final result is 454.

Boomerangs.","Alyssa picked a total of 378 + 225 + 149 = 752 fruits.
Nancy picked a total of 427 + 134 + 202 = 763 fruits.

Together, Alyssa and Nancy picked a total of 752 + 763 = 1515 fruits.

To find the average number of each type of fruit picked by a person, we divide the total number of each type of fruit picked by the number of people (2 in this case).

For pears: 378 + 427 = 805 pears / 2 = 402.5 pears per person.
For apples: 225 + 134 = 359 apples / 2 = 179.5 apples per person.
For oranges: 149 + 202 = 351 oranges / 2 = 175.5 oranges per person.

So, the average number of each type of fruit picked by a person is:
- 402.5 pears per person
- 179.5 apples per person
- 175.5 oranges per person",454,175.5,179.5

31.3 calories/bar * 2.5 bars/day = 78.25 calories/day

Next, you would multiply the daily calorie consumption by the number of days:

78.25 calories/day * 37 days = 2895.25 calories

Therefore, you consumed a total of 2895.25 calories in candy bars during the 37 days.","We first multiply the number of calories in one candy bar by the amount of candy bars eaten per day: 31.3 calories * 2.5 candy bars = 78.25 calories per day.

129,"Ellen went to a garage sale to buy chairs. Each chair originally costs 20 dollars, but they were on sale at a 25% discount. In addition, there is a 6% sales tax applied to the final cost of the chairs. How much did Ellen spend on the 12 chairs she bought?","First, let's calculate the discount on each chair. A 25% discount on a $20 chair is:

0.25 * $20 = $5

So, each chair is discounted by $5, making the new price of each chair:

$20 - $5 = $15

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 12 chairs at the discounted price:

12 chairs * $15/chair = $180

Next, we need to calculate the sales tax on the total cost. The sales tax is 6%, so:

0.06 * $180 = $10.80

Finally, we add the sales tax to the total cost to find out how much Ellen spent:

$180 + $10.80 = $190.80

Ellen spent $190.80 on the 12 chairs.","Ellen first gets a 25% discount on each chair, lowering the price from $20 to $15. Multiplying the new price by the quantity yields a total of $180. Calculating 6% of this new total results in a sales tax amount of $10.80. Adding the cost of the chairs and the tax together, Ellen's final expense comes to $190.80. 

$190.80","First, let's calculate the discount on each chair. Since the discount is 25%, we multiply the original cost of each chair by 0.25 to get the discount amount.

Discount per chair = Original cost per chair * Discount percentage
Discount per chair = $20 * 0.25
Discount per chair = $5

Now, let's calculate the new cost per chair after the discount.

New cost per chair = Original cost per chair - Discount per chair
New cost per chair = $20 - $5
New cost per chair = $15

Ellen bought 12 chairs, so we multiply the new cost per chair by the number of chairs to get the total cost before tax.

Total cost before tax = New cost per chair * Number of chairs
Total cost before tax = $15 * 12
Total cost before tax = $180

Now, we need to calculate the sales tax. Since the sales tax is 6%, we multiply the total cost before tax by 0.06 to get the tax amount.

Sales tax = Total cost before tax * Sales tax percentage
Sales tax = $180 * 0.06
Sales tax = $10.80

Finally, we add the sales tax to the total cost before tax to get the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost before tax + Sales tax
Final cost = $180 + $10.80
Final cost = $190.80

The restaurant served chocolate cakes twice as often as vanilla cakes, and strawberry cakes half as often as chocolate cakes. If the restaurant served 12 vanilla cakes during lunch and 18 during dinner over the entire week, how many cakes of each type were served in total?","Let's denote the number of chocolate cakes served as C, the number of vanilla cakes as V, and the number of strawberry cakes as S.

According to the information given:
- The restaurant served chocolate cakes twice as often as vanilla cakes, so C = 2V.
- The restaurant served strawberry cakes half as often as chocolate cakes, so S = C/2.

We also know that the restaurant served 12 vanilla cakes during lunch and 18 during dinner, so the total number of vanilla cakes served is:
V = 12 (lunch) + 18 (dinner) = 30.

Now we can find the number of chocolate and strawberry cakes served using the relationships we established:
C = 2V = 2 * 30 = 60 (chocolate cakes).
S = C/2 = 60/2 = 30 (strawberry cakes).

Therefore, the restaurant served a total of:

In total, the restaurant served 60 + 12 + 30 = 102 cakes during the week.

**102**","Let's denote the number of chocolate cakes served as C, the number of vanilla cakes served as V, and the number of strawberry cakes served as S.

According to the information given, the restaurant served chocolate cakes twice as often as vanilla cakes, so C = 2V.

The restaurant served strawberry cakes half as often as chocolate cakes, so S = C/2 = (2V)/2 = V.

We are given that the restaurant served 12 vanilla cakes during lunch and 18 during dinner over the entire week. Since there are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, we can assume that the restaurant served cakes during lunch and dinner each day.

So, the total number of vanilla cakes served over the week is 12 (lunch) + 18 (dinner) = 30.

Since C = 2V, we can find the total number of chocolate cakes served by multiplying the total number of vanilla cakes by 2: C = 2V = 2 * 30 = 60.

135,"In a large orchard, the farmers reported that they harvest 75 sacks of apples from each of the 15 sections daily. Additionally, they mentioned that on weekends, the harvest increases by 20% due to favorable weather conditions. How many sacks are harvested on weekdays and weekends, and what is the total number of sacks harvested weekly?","First, let's calculate the number of sacks harvested on a weekday:

Each section yields 75 sacks, and there are 15 sections, so on a weekday, the total harvest is:
75 sacks/section * 15 sections = 1125 sacks/day

Since the harvest increases by 20% on weekends, let's calculate the weekend harvest per day:

20% of 1125 sacks = 0.20 * 1125 = 225 sacks
So, the total harvest on a weekend day is:
1125 sacks + 225 sacks = 1350 sacks/day

Now, let's calculate the total number of sacks harvested in a week:

There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

Weekday harvest for 5 days:
1125 sacks/day * 5 days = 5625 sacks

Weekend harvest for 2 days:
1350 sacks/day * 2 days = 2700 sacks

The total number of sacks harvested weekly is:
5625 sacks (weekdays) + 2700 sacks (weekends) = 8325 sacks

In summary:
- Weekdays: 1125 sacks/day
- Weekends: 1350 sacks/day
- Total weekly: 8325 sacks","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Each section produces 75 sacks of apples daily: 75 x 15 sections = 1125 sacks harvested on weekdays.

2. Weekend harvest increase: 1125 x 20% = 225 sacks.

3. Additional weekend harvest: 1125 + 225 = 1350 sacks.

Therefore, the orchard harvests 1125 sacks on weekdays and 1350 sacks on weekends. Weekly, this adds up to 2475 sacks.

The final result: 2475.","On weekdays, the farmers harvest 75 sacks of apples from each of the 15 sections, so the total number of sacks harvested on weekdays is:

75 sacks/section * 15 sections = 1125 sacks

On weekends, the harvest increases by 20%, so the total number of sacks harvested on weekends is:

1125 sacks * 1.20 = 1350 sacks

The total number of sacks harvested weekly is the sum of the sacks harvested on weekdays and weekends:

1125 sacks (weekdays) + 1350 sacks (weekends) = 2475 sacks

She also bought a bottle of vanilla extract for $4.95, measured in ounces. If she uses 3 eggs per cake and 1/4 cup of flour per cake, and the vanilla extract bottle contains 12 ounces, and each cake needs 1 ounce of vanilla extract, how much did Sally spend on the ingredients and how many cakes can she bake using the total ingredients purchased?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs, flour, and vanilla extract.

Eggs: 4 dozen at $3.50 per dozen
4 dozen * $3.50/dozen = $14.00

Flour: 3 bags at $2.25 per bag
3 bags * $2.25/bag = $6.75

Vanilla extract: 1 bottle at $4.95
1 bottle * $4.95 = $4.95

Total cost of ingredients:
$14.00 (eggs) + $6.75 (flour) + $4.95 (vanilla extract) = $25.70

Now, let's calculate how many cakes Sally can bake with the ingredients purchased.

Eggs: 4 dozen eggs * 12 eggs/dozen = 48 eggs
Since she uses 3 eggs per cake, she can bake:
48 eggs / 3 eggs/cake = 16 cakes

Flour: Since we don't have the total amount of flour in cups, we can't calculate the number of cakes based on flour. We would need to know how many cups are in each bag of flour to determine this.

Vanilla extract: The bottle contains 12 ounces, and each cake needs 1 ounce.
12 ounces / 1 ounce/cake = 12 cakes

The limiting factor will be the ingredient that runs out first, which in this case is the vanilla extract. Therefore, Sally can bake 12 cakes with the vanilla extract she has.

Sally spent a total of $25.70 on the ingredients and can bake 12 cakes using the total ingredients purchased.","Sally's trip to the grocery store cost her $14.70 for the eggs and flour alone, with the vanilla extract adding another $4.95, bringing her total to $19.65.

She can make 16 cakes using all the ingredients she bought.

The final result is 16 cakes.","First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs and flour:

Cost of eggs = 4 dozen eggs * $3.50/dozen = $14
Cost of flour = 3 bags of flour * $2.25/bag = $6.75

Now, let's add the cost of the vanilla extract:

Total cost = Cost of eggs + Cost of flour + Cost of vanilla extract
Total cost = $14 + $6.75 + $4.95
Total cost = $25.70

Next, let's calculate the number of cakes Sally can bake using the ingredients she purchased:

Number of eggs per cake = 3 eggs/cake
Number of bags of flour per cake = 1/4 cup of flour/cake
Number of ounces of vanilla extract per cake = 1 ounce/cake

Since Sally bought 4 dozen eggs, she has:

Number of eggs = 4 dozen eggs * 12 eggs/dozen = 48 eggs

Since Sally bought 3 bags of flour, she has:

Number of bags of flour = 3 bags

Now, let's calculate the number of cakes she can bake using the eggs and flour:

Number of cakes with eggs = Number of eggs / Number of eggs per cake
Number of cakes with eggs = 48 eggs / 3 eggs/cake = 16 cakes

Number of cakes with flour = Number of bags of flour / Number of bags of flour per cake
Number of cakes with flour = 3 bags / 1/4 cup/bag = 3 * 4 = 12 cakes

Since Sally bought 12 ounces of vanilla extract, and each cake needs 1 ounce, she can bake:

Number of cakes with vanilla extract = Total ounces of vanilla extract / Ounces of vanilla extract per cake
Number of cakes with vanilla extract = 12 ounces / 1 ounce/cake = 12 cakes

Now, let's find the total number of cakes Sally can bake using all the ingredients:

Total number of cakes = Number of cakes with eggs + Number of cakes with flour + Number of cakes with vanilla extract

138,"Benny received 150 dollars for his birthday. He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove, baseball, bat, a cap, and a pair of cleats. The store offered a 10% discount on all items, but there was a 5% sales tax applied. After the purchase, Benny had 25 dollars left. How much did he spend on the baseball gear, including the discount and sales tax?","Let's denote the total cost of the baseball gear before the discount as \( x \).

Benny received a 10% discount on this amount, so the discounted price is \( x - 0.10x = 0.90x \).

After the discount, a 5% sales tax is applied, so the final cost is \( 0.90x + 0.05(0.90x) = 0.90x + 0.045x = 0.945x \).

Benny had $150 and was left with $25 after the purchase, so he spent \( 150 - 25 = 125 \) dollars on the baseball gear.

Now we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.945x = 125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.945:

\[ x = \frac{125}{0.945} \]

\[ x \approx 132.28 \]

So, the total cost of the baseball gear before the discount and sales tax was approximately $132.28. Benny spent $125 on the baseball gear, including the discount and sales tax.","Benny's total spending on the baseball gear comes out to **$126.50**.

Breakdown:
1. The full price of the gear would sum up to $150 - $25 = $125

2. With the 10% discount, the price goes down by $12.50. So, $125 - $12.50 = $112.50

3. But, we also have to consider the 5% sales tax. This adds $5.63 to the total. So, $112.50 + $5.63 = $118.13

4. Finally, we'll subtract the remaining amount Benny has left. $118.13 - $25 = $93.13. But we aim to provide a whole number or a single-word answer, so rounding it up to the nearest dollar amount, it comes to **$94**.","Let's denote the total cost of the baseball gear before the discount as \( C \).

The store offered a 10% discount on all items, so the discount amount is \( 0.10 \times C \).

After the discount, the total cost of the baseball gear became \( C - 0.10 \times C = 0.90 \times C \).

There was a 5% sales tax applied, so the sales tax amount is \( 0.05 \times 0.90 \times C \).

Benny had 25 dollars left after the purchase, so the total amount he spent is \( 0.90 \times C + 0.05 \times 0.90 \times C \).

We can simplify this expression by combining the terms:

\( 0.90 \times C + 0.05 \times 0.90 \times C = 0.90 \times C + 0.045 \times 0.90 \times C \)

\( 0.90 \times C + 0.045 \times 0.90 \times C = 0.90 \times C + 0.0405 \times C \)

\( 0.90 \times C + 0.0405 \times C = 1.0405 \times C \)

Now, let's find the value of \( C \) that makes the total amount spent equal to the amount Benny had left after the purchase:

\( 1.0405 \times C = 25 \)

\( C = \frac{25}{1.0405} \)

\( C = 24 \)

So, Benny spent 24 dollars on the baseball gear, including the discount and sales tax.",94,Twenty four,132.28

If Haley has 70 marbles and wants to distribute them equally to each of the boys so that each of them receives the same number of marbles with a fraction of a marble, how many marbles will each of the boys receive?","To distribute 70 marbles equally among 8 boys, we divide the total number of marbles by the number of boys:

70 marbles ÷ 8 boys = 8.75 marbles per boy

Since it's not possible to give a fraction of a marble, we can say that each boy will receive 8 marbles and there will be a remainder. However, if we are considering a scenario where a fraction of a marble can be given, then each boy would receive 8.75 marbles.","To solve this, we divide Haley's total marbles by the number of boys: 70 ÷ 8 = 8.75.

4. Pineapple for $4.25
5. Starfruit for $3.98

At the checkout, Alyssa learns that there is a 10% tax on the purchase, and she also has a discount coupon for $3 off the total cost. How much money did Alyssa spend in total after applying the tax and the discount coupon?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits before tax and discount:

Grapes: $12.08
Cherries: $9.85
Mangoes: $7.50
Pineapple: $4.25
Starfruit: $3.98

Total cost before tax and discount = $12.08 + $9.85 + $7.50 + $4.25 + $3.98
Total cost before tax and discount = $37.66

Now, let's calculate the tax:

Tax = 10% of $37.66
Tax = 0.10 * $37.66
Tax = $3.766

Since tax is usually rounded to the nearest cent, the tax would be $3.77.

Now, let's add the tax to the total cost before tax and discount:

Total cost with tax = $37.66 + $3.77
Total cost with tax = $41.43

Finally, let's apply the $3 discount coupon:

Total cost after discount = $41.43 - $3
Total cost after discount = $38.43

Alyssa spent $38.43 in total after applying the tax and the discount coupon.","Alyssa's shopping bill comes to $38.66 before the tax is applied. Ten percent of $38.66 is $3.87, bringing the total cost after tax to $42.53. With the $3 discount, Alyssa's final bill comes to a total of $39.53.

If he wants to distribute the paper clips in 23 boxes, how many paper clips will each box contain, and how many paper clips will be left over?","To find out how many paper clips each box will contain, we need to divide the total number of paper clips by the number of boxes. 

629 paper clips ÷ 23 boxes = 27 paper clips per box with a remainder.

To find the remainder, we multiply the number of paper clips each box will contain by the number of boxes and subtract that from the total number of paper clips:

27 paper clips/box × 23 boxes = 621 paper clips
629 total paper clips - 621 paper clips = 8 paper clips left over

So, each box will contain 27 paper clips, and there will be 8 paper clips left over.","We're asked to determine the number of paper clips that will go into each box and the excess clips left over from Lexie's room. We know that the total count of paper clips is 629. Lexie's brother intends to distribute them across 23 boxes. 

To find the number of paper clips per box, we can divide the total number by the number of boxes: 629 ÷ 23 = 27.65, or 28 paper clips. 

When we allocate 28 paper clips to each box, we'll have 1 leftover. 

Therefore, each box will contain 28 paper clips, and 1 will be left over.","If Lexie's younger brother wants to distribute the 629 paper clips in 23 boxes, we can calculate the number of paper clips each box will contain by dividing the total number of paper clips by the number of boxes.

Number of paper clips per box = Total number of paper clips ÷ Number of boxes
Number of paper clips per box = 629 ÷ 23
Number of paper clips per box = 27

Now, let's calculate the number of paper clips left over after distributing them in the boxes.

Number of paper clips left over = Total number of paper clips - (Number of paper clips per box × Number of boxes)
Number of paper clips left over = 629 - (27 × 23)
Number of paper clips left over = 629 - 621

However, two of her cousins are new to origami and she decides to give them 3 extra papers each for practicing purposes. How many origami papers will each of the remaining 8 cousins receive if she distributes the remaining papers equally among them?","First, let's set aside the extra papers for the two new cousins. Since Haley wants to give them 3 extra papers each, that's a total of 3 papers * 2 cousins = 6 extra papers.

Now, subtract those 6 extra papers from the total of 90 papers to find out how many papers are left to distribute among the remaining 8 cousins:
90 papers - 6 extra papers = 84 papers.

Now, divide the 84 papers evenly among the 8 cousins:
84 papers / 8 cousins = 10.5 papers per cousin.

Since you can't give half a paper, let's assume that Haley will give whole papers only. In that case, each of the 8 cousins would receive 10 papers, and there would be 4 papers left over (since 8 cousins * 10 papers = 80 papers, and 84 - 80 = 4).

Haley could then decide to give the remaining 4 papers to any of the cousins or keep them for another time. But based on the initial plan, each of the 8 cousins would receive 10 origami papers.","Haley has 90 papers to share among her cousins. She first sets aside 3 extra papers for each of the two cousins who are beginners, which amounts to 2 * 3 = 6 papers. The remaining number of papers is 90 - 6 = 84. 

When these are divided equally among the remaining 8 cousins, each cousin will receive 84 / 8 = 10.5 papers.

The result is: 11.","Haley has 90 origami papers to give away. She gives 3 extra papers to each of the two new cousins, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 extra papers.

1 dozen quarters from washing cars:
1 dozen = 12 quarters
1 quarter = $0.25
12 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $3.00

3 five-dollar bills from mowing lawns:
3 bills * $5/bill = $15.00

2 dozen dimes from selling lemonade:
2 dozen = 24 dimes
1 dime = $0.10
24 dimes * $0.10/dime = $2.40

Now, let's add up all the amounts to get the total in dollars:
$3.00 (quarters) + $15.00 (five-dollar bills) + $2.40 (dimes) = $20.40

Now, we convert the total amount in dollars to euros using the exchange rate of 1.12 dollars per euro:
$20.40 / 1.12 dollars/euro = €18.21 (rounded to two decimal places)

Converting this to euros, we multiply by the exchange rate: $18.48 * 1.12 = €20.74.

€20.74 is the final amount.","First, let's calculate the total amount of money Nancy has in dollars.

Nancy has 1 dozen quarters, which is equivalent to 12 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so 12 quarters are worth:

At the end of the regular season, the top 4 teams compete in a 3-round eliminations for the championship. Each round consists of 2 games, regardless of outcome. How many total baseball games are played in the season including the playoff games?","First, let's calculate the total number of games played during the regular season. Since there are 8 teams and each team plays 7 games a month, we can calculate the total number of games played in one month as follows:

Total games in one month = (Number of teams / 2) * Number of games each team plays
                         = (8 / 2) * 7
                         = 4 * 7
                         = 28 games

Since the season is played for 2 months, we need to double the number of games played in one month to find the total number of games played in the regular season:

Total games in regular season = Total games in one month * Number of months
                              = 28 games * 2
                              = 56 games

Next, let's calculate the total number of games played in the playoffs. There are 3 rounds of eliminations, and each round consists of 2 games, regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the total number of playoff games is:

Total playoff games = Number of rounds * Number of games per round
                    = 3 * 2
                    = 6 games

Finally, to find the total number of games played in the entire season, we add the total number of regular season games to the total number of playoff games:

Total games in the season = Total games in regular season + Total playoff games
                          = 56 games + 6 games
                          = 62 games

Therefore, a total of 62 baseball games are played in the season including the playoff games.","We first calculate the number of regular-season games, which is 8 teams x 7 games/month x 2 months = 112 games.
The playoff games are 4 teams x 3 rounds x 2 games/round = 24 games.
Adding the regular season and playoff games, we get a total of 112 games + 24 games = 136 games.
**136**","First, let's calculate the total number of regular season games played by each team.

Each team plays 7 games a month, and the season is played for 2 months. So, each team plays:

7 games/month * 2 months = 14 games/team

Now, let's calculate the total number of regular season games played by all teams combined:

14 games/team * 8 teams = 112 regular season games

Next, let's calculate the total number of playoff games played.

The top 4 teams compete in a 3-round elimination for the championship. Each round consists of 2 games, regardless of outcome. So, in each round, there are 2 games * 4 teams = 8 games.

Since there are 3 rounds, the total number of playoff games is:

8 games/round * 3 rounds = 24 playoff games

Finally, let's add the regular season games and the playoff games to get the total number of baseball games played in the season:

146,"Jane had been saving large empty cans to serve as pots for sunflowers. She has three different sizes of cans: small, medium, and large, with capacities for 2, 3, and 4 seeds respectively. She has 54 sunflower seeds with different germination rates: 75% for type A, 85% for type B, and 95% for type C seeds. There are 9 cans in total, with 3 of each size. Considering the size of the cans and germination rates, how should she distribute the seeds in each can to maximize the chances of successful sunflower growth?","To maximize the chances of successful sunflower growth, Jane should consider both the germination rates of the seeds and the capacity of the cans. Since the germination rates are different for each type of seed, she should prioritize placing the seeds with the highest germination rate in the cans with the most capacity, and so on.

Let's start by distributing the seeds with the highest germination rate (type C, 95%) into the largest cans:

- Large cans (4 seeds capacity): Since there are 3 large cans, she can plant a total of 3 x 4 = 12 seeds. With a 95% germination rate, the expected number of successful germinations would be 12 x 0.95 = 11.4.

Next, let's distribute the seeds with the second-highest germination rate (type B, 85%) into the medium cans:

- Medium cans (3 seeds capacity): There are also 3 medium cans, so she can plant a total of 3 x 3 = 9 seeds. With an 85% germination rate, the expected number of successful germinations would be 9 x 0.85 = 7.65.

Finally, let's distribute the seeds with the lowest germination rate (type A, 75%) into the small cans:

- Small cans (2 seeds capacity): With 3 small cans, she can plant a total of 3 x 2 = 6 seeds. With a 75% germination rate, the expected number of successful germinations would be 6 x 0.75 = 4.5.

Now, let's check if we have enough seeds of each type to follow this distribution:

- Type C seeds needed: 12 (for large cans)
- Type B seeds needed: 9 (for medium cans)
- Type A seeds needed: 6 (for small cans)

Total seeds needed: 12 + 9 + 6 = 27 seeds.

Since Jane has 54 seeds in total, she can use half of them for the first round of planting following the distribution above. She can then repeat the same distribution for the second round of planting with the remaining seeds.

By following this strategy, Jane maximizes the chances of successful sunflower growth by using the cans' capacities efficiently and taking advantage of the different germination rates of the seeds.","Jane should distribute the seeds as follows:

- Large can: 3 type-C seeds and 1 type-B seed
- Medium can: 2 type-C seeds and 1 type-A seed
- Small can: 1 type-B seed and 1 type-A seed

The chances of successful sunflower growth are maximized with this distribution.
 
Success.","To maximize the chances of successful sunflower growth, Jane should distribute the seeds in each can based on the size of the cans and the germination rates of the seeds.

First, let's calculate the expected number of seeds that will germinate for each type of seed:

- For type A seeds, 75% of the seeds will germinate, so we multiply the number of seeds by 0.75: 54 seeds * 0.75 = 40.5 seeds.
- For type B seeds, 85% of the seeds will germinate, so we multiply the number of seeds by 0.85: 54 seeds * 0.85 = 46.05 seeds.
- For type C seeds, 95% of the seeds will germinate, so we multiply the number of seeds by 0.95: 54 seeds * 0.95 = 51.3 seeds.

Now, let's distribute the seeds in each can based on the size of the cans and the expected number of seeds that will germinate:

- For the small cans, we have 3 seeds * 2 seeds/can = 6 seeds.
- For the medium cans, we have 3 seeds * 3 seeds/can = 9 seeds.
- For the large cans, we have 3 seeds * 4 seeds/can = 12 seeds.

Now, let's distribute the seeds based on the germination rates:

- For the small cans, we have 6 seeds, and we distribute them as follows: 2 seeds for type A, 2 seeds for type B, and 2 seeds for type C.
- For the medium cans, we have 9 seeds, and we distribute them as follows: 3 seeds for type A, 3 seeds for type B, and 3 seeds for type C.
- For the large cans, we have 12 seeds, and we distribute them as follows: 4 seeds for type A, 4 seeds for type B, and 4 seeds for type C.

This distribution ensures that the cans with the largest capacity have the highest number of seeds, and the germination rates are considered as well. However, please note that this is just one possible distribution, and there may be other ways to distribute the seeds to maximize the chances of successful sunflower growth.",Success.,12,27

We know that the Spurs have x = 22 players and the Rockets have y = 18 players. Each player from both teams has z = 11 basketballs.

To find the total number of basketballs, we'll multiply the number of players each team has, by the number of basketballs each player holds.

The formula would be: Total basketballs = x * z + y * z

1. Initially, Sam had:
- Dimes: 9
- Nickels: 5
- Pennies: 12

2. His dad gave him 7 more dimes and took 3 nickels:
- Dimes: 9 (initial) + 7 (from dad) = 16 dimes
- Nickels: 5 (initial) - 3 (taken by dad) = 2 nickels
- Pennies: 12 (initial)

3. Sam exchanged the 12 pennies for 2 more dimes and 2 pennies:
- Dimes: 16 (current) + 2 (from exchange) = 18 dimes
- Nickels: 2 (current)
- Pennies: 12 (initial) - 12 (exchanged) + 2 (from exchange) = 2 pennies

Now, let's calculate the total value of each type of coin in cents:
- Dimes: 18 dimes * 10 cents each = 180 cents
- Nickels: 2 nickels * 5 cents each = 10 cents
- Pennies: 2 pennies * 1 cent each = 2 cents

Total value in cents:

6 people × 52 cards/person = 312 cards

So, they have 312 baseball cards in all.","We have six people, each with 52 baseball cards. To find the total number of cards, we multiply the number of cards per person by the number of people: 52 x 6 = 312.

152,"Sally has 6 blue balloons. Fred has 3 times more blue balloons than Sally. After a party on Saturday, George received 7 more blue balloons and now has twice as many blue balloons as Fred. How many blue balloons does George have now?","Let's break it down step by step:

1. Sally has 6 blue balloons.
2. Fred has 3 times more blue balloons than Sally, so Fred has 3 * 6 = 18 blue balloons.
3. After the party, George received 7 more blue balloons and now has twice as many blue balloons as Fred. Let's call the number of blue balloons George had before the party G.

So, after receiving 7 more balloons, George has G + 7 balloons. We know that this amount is twice as many as Fred's balloons, so:

G + 7 = 2 * 18
G + 7 = 36
G = 36 - 7
G = 29

George now has 29 blue balloons.","Sally: 6 balloons
Fred: 3 x 6 = 18 balloons
George: 18 + 7 = 25 balloons
George has twice as many as Fred: 25 = 2 x 18

After the party, George received 7 more blue balloons, so he now has 6 + 7 = 13 blue balloons.

George has twice as many blue balloons as Fred, so George has 2 * 18 = 36 blue balloons.",25,36,29
153,"My car gets 20 miles per gallon of gas when it is 5 years old. Its fuel efficiency decreases at a rate of 2%/year as it ages. How many miles can I drive on 5 gallons of gas when the car is 8 years old, taking into account the change in fuel efficiency? The car can use both gasoline and ethanol, with the ethanol efficiency being 80% that of gasoline. What would be the difference in miles driven if I used 5 gallons of ethanol instead of gasoline at 8 years old?","First, let's calculate the fuel efficiency of the car when it is 8 years old. The car's fuel efficiency decreases at a rate of 2% per year. To find the fuel efficiency at 8 years old, we need to calculate the decrease over 3 years (since the car is already 5 years old).

The formula to calculate the decrease in fuel efficiency is:

New efficiency = Original efficiency * (1 - rate of decrease) ^ number of years

The rate of decrease is 2%, or 0.02 as a decimal. The number of years is 3.

New efficiency = 20 miles per gallon * (1 - 0.02) ^ 3
New efficiency = 20 * (0.98) ^ 3
New efficiency = 20 * 0.941192
New efficiency ≈ 18.82384 miles per gallon

Now, let's calculate how many miles you can drive on 5 gallons of gas when the car is 8 years old:

Miles driven = Fuel efficiency * Number of gallons
Miles driven = 18.82384 miles per gallon * 5 gallons
Miles driven ≈ 94.1192 miles

Next, let's calculate the difference in miles driven if you used 5 gallons of ethanol instead of gasoline at 8 years old. Ethanol efficiency is 80% that of gasoline, so we multiply the gasoline efficiency by 0.8:

Ethanol efficiency = Gasoline efficiency * 0.8
Ethanol efficiency = 18.82384 miles per gallon * 0.8
Ethanol efficiency ≈ 15.059072 miles per gallon

Now, let's calculate how many miles you can drive on 5 gallons of ethanol:

Miles driven with ethanol = Ethanol efficiency * Number of gallons
Miles driven with ethanol = 15.059072 miles per gallon * 5 gallons
Miles driven with ethanol ≈ 75.29536 miles

Finally, let's find the difference in miles driven between gasoline and ethanol:

Difference in miles = Miles driven with gasoline - Miles driven with ethanol
Difference in miles ≈ 94.1192 miles - 75.29536 miles
Difference in miles ≈ 18.82384 miles

So, if you used 5 gallons of ethanol instead of gasoline at 8 years old, you would drive approximately 18.82384 fewer miles.","When the car is 8 years old, its fuel efficiency has decreased by 12% ((8 - 5) x 2% = 12%). Therefore, the fuel efficiency is now 88% of what it was when the car was 5 years old. 

With gasoline, the car can travel 20 x 88% = 17.6 miles per gallon. So, with 5 gallons of gasoline, the car can drive roughly 17.6 x 5 = 88 miles.

Using ethanol instead of gasoline would mean a reduction in fuel efficiency of 20% (1 - 80% = 20%). The car can now travel only 88% x 20% = 14.08 miles per gallon. 5 gallons of ethanol will take the car approximately 14.08 x 5 = 70.4 miles.

The difference in distance driven is 88 miles - 70.4 miles = 17.6 miles.

The final result is: 17.6.","Let's calculate the fuel efficiency when the car is 8 years old.

The fuel efficiency decreases at a rate of 2%/year. So, when the car is 8 years old, the fuel efficiency will be:

20 miles/gallon - (2% * 8 years) = 20 miles/gallon - 0.16 = 19.84 miles/gallon

Now, let's calculate the miles driven on 5 gallons of gas when the car is 8 years old:

19.84 miles/gallon * 5 gallons = 99.2 miles

Next, let's calculate the miles driven on 5 gallons of ethanol when the car is 8 years old. Since the ethanol efficiency is 80% that of gasoline, the ethanol efficiency would be:

80% of 19.84 miles/gallon = 0.8 * 19.84 = 15.872 miles/gallon

Now, let's calculate the miles driven on 5 gallons of ethanol:

15.872 miles/gallon * 5 gallons = 79.36 miles

Finally, let's find the difference in miles driven if we used 5 gallons of ethanol instead of gasoline at 8 years old:

99.2 miles (gasoline) - 79.36 miles (ethanol) = 19.84 miles

So, the difference in miles driven if we used 5 gallons of ethanol instead of gasoline at 8 years old would be approximately 19.84 miles.",17.6,19.84,18.82384

Total pieces of candy = 3409.7
Red pieces = 145.5
Blue pieces = 785.2

Green pieces = Total pieces - Red pieces - Blue pieces
Green pieces = 3409.7 - 145.5 - 785.2

Now, let's do the math:

Green pieces = 3409.7 - 145.5 - 785.2
Green pieces = 3409.7 - 930.7
Green pieces = 2479

So, there were 2479 pieces of green candy in the jar.","We know that the total number of pieces of candy is 3409.7 and that 145.5 pieces are red and 785.2 pieces are blue. 

If we subtract the sum of these two amounts from the total, we get the number of green pieces.

3409.7 - 145.5 - 785.2 = 1489.0

To find the total number of pieces that were not red or blue, we subtract the number of red and blue pieces from the total number of pieces:

Total pieces - (Red pieces + Blue pieces) = Green pieces
3409.7 - (145.5 + 785.2) = Green pieces

Today, park workers are planting 14 Kousa dogwood trees along with 35 Flowering dogwoods. After planting, they decide to divide the total number of dogwoods equally among four different locations within the park. How many dogwood trees will be at each location when the workers are finished?","First, let's find out the total number of dogwood trees after the workers finish planting the new ones.

Currently, there are:
- 18 Pacific dogwoods
- 16 Flowering dogwoods

They are planting:
- 14 Kousa dogwoods
- 35 Flowering dogwoods

Adding the new trees to the existing ones, we get:
- Pacific dogwoods: 18 (no change)
- Flowering dogwoods: 16 + 35 = 51
- Kousa dogwoods: 14 (new addition)

Now, let's find the total number of dogwood trees:
Total dogwoods = Pacific dogwoods + Flowering dogwoods + Kousa dogwoods
Total dogwoods = 18 + 51 + 14
Total dogwoods = 83

The workers want to divide these 83 dogwood trees equally among four locations. To find out how many trees will be at each location, we divide the total number by the number of locations:
Number of trees per location = Total dogwoods / Number of locations
Number of trees per location = 83 / 4
Number of trees per location = 20.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a tree, we'll need to round down to the nearest whole number because you can't plant a fraction of a tree. So, there will be 20 dogwood trees at each location. However, this leaves us with 3 trees unaccounted for (since 20 trees at each location times 4 locations equals 80 trees, and we have 83 in total).

To distribute these 3 remaining trees, you could add one tree to three of the locations. This would result in three locations having 21 trees and one location having 20 trees.","We begin with 34 dogwood trees, consisting of 18 Pacific and 16 Flowering species. Today's planting endeavor involves adding 14 Kousa and 35 Flowering dogwood trees. Thus, the total number of dogwood trees before the division is: 34 + 14 + 35 = 83 dogwood trees. Park workers then divide these equally among four locations, which gives us: 83 ÷ 4 = 20.75 trees per location. Since we can't have half a tree, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, each location will have **21 trees**.","First, let's calculate the total number of dogwood trees before planting:

34 dogwood trees (currently in the park) + 14 Kousa dogwood trees (to be planted) + 35 Flowering dogwoods (to be planted) = 83 dogwood trees

Now, let's divide the total number of dogwood trees equally among four different locations:

83 dogwood trees ÷ 4 locations = 20.75 dogwood trees per location

Since we can't have a fraction of a tree, we'll have to round to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round down to 20 dogwood trees per location.

If he wants to distribute these 427 apples equally amongst his 11 baskets, we divide the total number of apples by the number of baskets:

427 apples ÷ 11 baskets = 38.8181818181 apples per basket.

Since we can't have a fraction of an apple in a basket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 38 apples per basket. However, this means there will be some apples left over.

230 (games after buying) - 22 (desired final number of games) = 208 games to give away

Now, we need to divide the number of games to give away by the number of games given to each friend:

208 games to give away / 4 games per friend = 52 friends

Kelly can give games to 52 friends before ending up with 22 games.","Kelly has 200 games and will give 4 away to each friend.

We want to find out how many friends x can receive games before Kelly is left with 22 games.

We plug in 22 into the equation and solve for x:
200 - 4 * x + 30 = 22
200 - 4 * x = -8 (subtracting 30 from both sides)
x = 5

Kelly starts with 200 games and gives away 4 to each friend. To find out how many games she gives away in total, we multiply the number of games per friend by the total number of friends:

4 games/friend * total number of friends = total number of games given away

We don't know the total number of friends yet, so we'll call it x.

Now, let's find out how many games Kelly has left after giving away 4 to each friend:

How many clowns are inside all the clown mobiles across the three acts combined?","To find the total number of clowns across the three acts, we need to calculate the number of clowns in each act and then add them together.

In the first act, there are 8 clown mobiles with 35 clowns each. So, the total number of clowns in the first act is:
8 clown mobiles * 35 clowns per mobile = 280 clowns

In the second act, there are 10 clown mobiles with 40 clowns each. So, the total number of clowns in the second act is:
10 clown mobiles * 40 clowns per mobile = 400 clowns

In the third act, there are 12 clown mobiles with 45 clowns each. So, the total number of clowns in the third act is:
12 clown mobiles * 45 clowns per mobile = 540 clowns

Now, we add the number of clowns from all three acts together:
280 clowns (first act) + 400 clowns (second act) + 540 clowns (third act) = 1220 clowns

Therefore, there are 1220 clowns inside all the clown mobiles across the three acts combined.","Let's solve this colorful circus question!

Act 1 has 8 clown mobiles x 35 clowns = 280 clowns.
Act 2 has 10 clown mobiles x 40 clowns = 400 clowns.
Act 3 has 12 clown mobiles x 45 clowns = 540 clowns.

Adding these together, we get a grand total of 280 + 400 + 540 = 1220 clowns across the three acts.

Therefore, the final answer is: **1220**.","In the first act, there are 8 clown mobiles with 35 clowns each, so the total number of clowns is:
8 clown mobiles * 35 clowns per mobile = 280 clowns

In the second act, there are 10 clown mobiles with 40 clowns each, so the total number of clowns is:
10 clown mobiles * 40 clowns per mobile = 400 clowns

In the third act, there are 12 clown mobiles with 45 clowns each, so the total number of clowns is:
12 clown mobiles * 45 clowns per mobile = 540 clowns

Now, let's add up the total number of clowns across all three acts:
280 clowns (first act) + 400 clowns (second act) + 540 clowns (third act) = 1220 clowns

So, there are 1220 clowns inside all the clown mobiles across the three acts combined.",1220,1220,1220
164,"Oceanside Bike Rental Shop charges a base fee of 17 dollars plus 7 dollars an hour for renting a standard bike. Additionally, they offer optional add-ons such as a helmet for a flat fee of 5 dollars, and a bike lock for an hourly fee of 2 dollars. Tom paid a total of 95 dollars to rent a bike, which included the helmet and lock fees. How many hours did he pay to have the bike and additional accessories checked out?","Let's break down the costs:

Base fee: $17
Helmet fee: $5 (flat fee)
Bike rental fee per hour: $7
Bike lock fee per hour: $2

Tom paid a total of $95, which includes the base fee, helmet fee, and the hourly fees for the bike rental and lock.

First, we subtract the base fee and the helmet fee from the total amount Tom paid to find out how much he paid for the hourly fees:

$95 - $17 (base fee) - $5 (helmet fee) = $73

Now, we have $73 that was spent on the hourly fees for the bike rental and the lock.

The combined hourly fee for the bike rental and the lock is $7 (bike) + $2 (lock) = $9 per hour.

To find out how many hours Tom paid for, we divide the remaining amount by the combined hourly fee:

$73 ÷ $9/hour = 8.11 hours

Since Tom cannot rent a bike for a fraction of an hour, we round down to the nearest whole hour. Therefore, Tom paid for 8 hours of bike and accessory rental.","To solve this math problem, we need to break down the costs and determine what expenses contribute to the total bill.

We know that the base fee for renting a bike is $17. Tom also rented a helmet for a flat fee of $5 and a bike lock for an unknown number of hours at $2 per hour. The total cost was $95.

We can now subtract the cost of the add-ons from the total to find the cost of renting the bike:
$95 - $5 (helmet) - ($2 x minimum 1 hour) = $83 for one hour of bike rental

The cost for each additional hour is $7, so for each extra hour, the cost increases by $7. We now subtract the base fee and multiply the hourly rate by a hypothetical number of hours:
$83 - $17 + ($7 x number of hours) = $95

Now we can solve for the number of hours:
7 x hours = $76
Hours = 11

The final result is: 11 hours.","Let's denote the number of hours Tom paid for as \( h \).

The total cost for renting the bike is the base fee plus the hourly fee for the number of hours:
\[ 17 + 7h \]

The total cost for the optional add-ons is the flat fee for the helmet plus the hourly fee for the lock:
\[ 5 + 2h \]

The total cost Tom paid is the sum of the bike rental and the add-ons:
\[ 17 + 7h + 5 + 2h \]

We know that the total cost is 95 dollars:
\[ 17 + 7h + 5 + 2h = 95 \]

Now, let's solve for \( h \):
\[ 17 + 7h + 5 + 2h = 95 \]
\[ 17 + 9h + 5 = 95 \]
\[ 9h + 22 = 95 \]
\[ 9h = 95 - 22 \]
\[ 9h = 73 \]
\[ h = \frac{73}{9} \]
\[ h = 8.11 \]

Since Tom can't pay a fraction of an hour, we'll round down to the nearest whole hour. Therefore, Tom paid for 8 hours to rent the bike and additional accessories.",11,8,8

After these transactions, he now has 56 books in his library. If Mike gave away 12 books to his friends, how many books did he buy at the yard sale?","Let's denote the number of books Mike bought at the yard sale as B.

Initially, Mike had 35 books. After giving away 12 books, he would have had 35 - 12 = 23 books left.

Since he ended up with 56 books, the number of books he bought at the yard sale must be the difference between the books he had after giving away and the final count. So:

56 (final count) - 23 (after giving away) = B (books bought at the yard sale)

Therefore, B = 56 - 23 = 33 books.

Mike bought 33 books at the yard sale.","Mike bought 29 books at the yard sale.

**29**","Mike started with 35 books and ended up with 56 books after the transactions. To find out how many books he bought, we need to calculate the difference between the number of books he had before and after the transactions.

Difference = 21 books

Mike gave away 12 books, so the number of books he bought is the difference minus the number of books he gave away.

167,"Haley has 63 magazines in her cabinet with varying weights. She plans to send them to the recycling office in their area. Each box can contain up to 9 magazines and has a weight limit of 15 pounds. The weights (in pounds) of the magazines are as follows:

1. 1.6, 1.4, 1.3, 1.8, 2.2, 1.5, 2.1, 1.9, 1.7
2. 2.3, 1.5, 1.1, 1.6, 1.9, 2.2, 2.0, 1.3, 2.4

7. 2.1, 2.0, 1.5, 1.1, 1.6, 1.8, 1.3, 1.6, 1.9

If Haley needs to optimize her box packing to use the least number of boxes without exceeding the weight limit, how should she pack the magazines into the boxes? ","To optimize the packing of the magazines into the boxes, we need to ensure that each box contains as close to 9 magazines as possible without exceeding the 15-pound weight limit. We can start by adding the weights of the magazines in each group to see if any group already meets the criteria, and then we can mix and match magazines from different groups to optimize the packing.

Let's calculate the total weight of each group of magazines:

1. 1.6 + 1.4 + 1.3 + 1.8 + 2.2 + 1.5 + 2.1 + 1.9 + 1.7 = 15.5 pounds (exceeds the limit)
2. 2.3 + 1.5 + 1.1 + 1.6 + 1.9 + 2.2 + 2.0 + 1.3 + 2.4 = 16.3 pounds (exceeds the limit)
3. 1.8 + 1.3 + 1.5 + 1.7 + 1.9 + 1.4 + 2.1 + 2.3 + 1.6 = 15.6 pounds (exceeds the limit)
4. 1.4 + 1.7 + 2.4 + 2.0 + 1.5 + 1.6 + 1.1 + 1.8 + 1.9 = 15.4 pounds (exceeds the limit)
5. 2.2 + 1.6 + 2.0 + 1.3 + 1.9 + 1.1 + 1.7 + 2.3 + 1.5 = 15.6 pounds (exceeds the limit)
6. 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.3 + 1.7 + 1.6 + 2.4 + 2.1 + 1.9 + 1.8 = 15.8 pounds (exceeds the limit)
7. 2.1 + 2.0 + 1.5 + 1.1 + 1.6 + 1.8 + 1.3 + 1.6 + 1.9 = 15.9 pounds (exceeds the limit)

Since all groups exceed the weight limit, we need to rearrange the magazines. We can start by grouping the lightest magazines together and then adding heavier ones until we reach the weight limit or the maximum number of magazines per box.

Let's start by creating the first box with the lightest magazines:

Box 1:
1.1, 1.1, 1.3, 1.3, 1.3, 1.4, 1.4, 1.5, 1.5 = 11.9 pounds

We can continue this process, always checking the total weight before adding another magazine. We should also keep track of the magazines we've already packed to avoid duplicates.

This process requires careful selection and calculation, which can be time-consuming to do manually. It would be more efficient to use an algorithm or a computer program to find the optimal packing solution. However, if you'd like me to continue with a manual approach, please let me know, and I'll do my best to provide a solution.","To solve this problem, we should distribute the magazines into the boxes optimally such that the total weight of each box does not exceed 15 pounds. We can begin by sorting the weights in descending order:

2.4, 2.4, 2.3, 2.3, 2.2, 2.2, 2.1, 2.1, 2.0, 2.0, 1.9, 1.9, 1.9, 1.8, 1.8, 1.7, 1.7, 1.6, 1.6, 1.6, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.4, 1.4, 1.3, 1.3, 1.3, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1

We can start packing the boxes with the heaviest magazines first.

Box 1: 2.4, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 1.9, 1.8, 1.7 = 14.8 lbs
Box 2: 2.3, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4 = 14.8 lbs
Box 3: 2.2, 2.1, 1.9, 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.3 = 14.6 lbs
Box 4: 2.0, 1.9, 1.8, 1.6, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3 = 14.6 lbs
Box 5: 1.9, 1.8, 1.7, 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.3, 1.1 = 14.4 lbs

Haley needs to use **five boxes** to send all the magazines without exceeding the weight limit.","To optimize the box packing, Haley should sort the magazines by weight in descending order and then pack the boxes starting with the heaviest magazines. This way, she can maximize the weight of each box without exceeding the limit.

Let's sort the magazines by weight in descending order:

1. 2.4
2. 2.3
3. 2.2
4. 2.1

8. 1.7
9. 1.6
10. 1.5
11. 1.4
12. 1.3
13. 1.1

Now, let's pack the boxes starting with the heaviest magazines:

Box 1: 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9, 1.8, 1.7, 1.6
Box 2: 1.5, 1.5, 1.3, 1.3, 1.1, 1.1, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0

Haley has used 2 boxes to pack all the magazines. Since each box can contain up to 9 magazines, and she has used 2 boxes, she has used a total of 2 * 9 = 18 magazines.

However, since the weight limit is 15 pounds per box, and the total weight of the magazines in Box 1 is 18.4 pounds, Haley cannot use Box 1 as it is. She needs to repack the magazines in Box 1 to ensure the weight limit is not exceeded.

Let's repack Box 1:

How much did Fred spend on all the cards, including discounts and taxes?","First, let's calculate the total cost for the football cards including sales tax.

The cost of one pack of football cards is $2.73. Since Fred bought 2 packs, the total cost before tax is:
2 packs * $2.73/pack = $5.46

Now, we calculate the sales tax for the football cards:
Sales tax for football cards = 5% of $5.46
Sales tax for football cards = 0.05 * $5.46
Sales tax for football cards = $0.273

The total cost for the football cards including tax is:
$5.46 + $0.273 = $5.733

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the Pokemon cards including sales tax.

The cost of the Pokemon cards is $4.01, and the sales tax rate is 8%.
Sales tax for Pokemon cards = 8% of $4.01
Sales tax for Pokemon cards = 0.08 * $4.01
Sales tax for Pokemon cards = $0.3208

The total cost for the Pokemon cards including tax is:
$4.01 + $0.3208 = $4.3308

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the baseball cards including the discount and sales tax.

The original price of the baseball cards is $10, but there is a 10% discount.
Discount amount = 10% of $10
Discount amount = 0.10 * $10
Discount amount = $1

The discounted price of the baseball cards is:
$10 - $1 = $9

Now, we calculate the sales tax for the baseball cards:
Sales tax for baseball cards = 6% of $9
Sales tax for baseball cards = 0.06 * $9
Sales tax for baseball cards = $0.54

The total cost for the baseball cards including tax is:
$9 + $0.54 = $9.54

Finally, let's add up the total cost for all the cards including discounts and taxes:
Total cost = Cost of football cards + Cost of Pokemon cards + Cost of baseball cards
Total cost = $5.733 + $4.3308 + $9.54
Total cost = $19.6038

Fred spent a total of $19.6038 on all the cards, including discounts and taxes.","Fred's card-buying adventure began with two packs of football cards, priced at $2.73 each. With a 5% sales tax rate, Fred calculated that each pack cost $2.87. Two packs would thus cost $5.74. 

The next stop saw him purchase a Pokemon card pack for $4.01, this time with an 8% sales tax included in the price. 

The baseball cards were a real bargain at a 10% discount on their original $10 price. With a 6% sales tax rate, Fred's math skills deduced that the final price, including tax, would be $9. Then, adding the two packs of football cards, Fred's total spend was $14.74.
 
So, the answer is **$14.74**.","First, let's calculate the sales tax for each item.

For the football cards:
Sales tax = 5% of $2.73
Sales tax = 0.05 * $2.73
Sales tax = $0.1365

For the Pokemon cards:
Sales tax = 8% of $4.01
Sales tax = 0.08 * $4.01
Sales tax = $0.3208

For the baseball cards:
Discount = 10% of $10
Discount = 0.10 * $10
Discount = $1.00

Sales tax = 6% of ($10 - $1.00)
Sales tax = 6% of $9
Sales tax = 0.06 * $9
Sales tax = $0.54

Now, let's add up the cost of the cards, including discounts and taxes:

Football cards = $2.73 + $0.1365 (tax)
Football cards = $2.8665

Pokemon cards = $4.01 + $0.3208 (tax)
Pokemon cards = $4.3308

Baseball cards = $10 - $1.00 (discount) + $0.54 (tax)
Baseball cards = $9.54

Total cost = $2.8665 (football cards) + $4.3308 (Pokemon cards) + $9.54 (baseball cards)

Dimes: She found 15 dimes in her jacket and 4 dimes in her shorts, for a total of 15 + 4 = 19 dimes. Since each dime is worth $0.10, the total value of the dimes is 19 * $0.10 = $1.90.

Nickels: She found 7 nickels in her shorts and 8 nickels in her backpack, for a total of 7 + 8 = 15 nickels. Since each nickel is worth $0.05, the total value of the nickels is 15 * $0.05 = $0.75.

Quarters: She found 12 quarters in her jeans. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is 12 * $0.25 = $3.00.

Pennies: She found 2 pennies in her jeans and 23 pennies in her backpack, for a total of 2 + 23 = 25 pennies. Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total value of the pennies is 25 * $0.01 = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total value of all the coins:

Total money = Total value of dimes + Total value of nickels + Total value of quarters + Total value of pennies

- In her jacket, she found 15 dimes, which is 15 * $0.10 = $1.50.
- In her shorts, she found 4 dimes and 7 nickels. Since a dime is worth $0.10 and a nickel is worth $0.05, the total amount from these is 4 * $0.10 + 7 * $0.05 = $0.40 + $0.35 = $0.75.
- In her jeans, she found 12 quarters, which is 12 * $0.25 = $3.00.
- In her jeans, she also found 2 pennies, which is 2 * $0.01 = $0.02.

For the Digimon cards:
4 packs * $4.45 each = $17.80

For the Pokemon cards:
3 packs * $5.25 each = $15.75

For the Yu-Gi-Oh cards:
6 packs * $3.99 each = $23.94

For the Magic: The Gathering cards:
2 packs * $6.75 each = $13.50

For the baseball cards:
1 deck * $6.06 each = $6.06

Tanner received a 10% discount on the video game and had to pay 5% sales tax on the total cost of his purchases. How much money does Tanner have left?","First, let's calculate the total amount Tanner saved from September to December:

September: $17
October: $48
November: $25
December: $55

Total saved = $17 + $48 + $25 + $55 = $145

Next, let's calculate the cost of the video game after the 10% discount:

Cost of video game before discount: $49
Discount amount (10% of $49): 0.10 * $49 = $4.90
Cost of video game after discount: $49 - $4.90 = $44.10

Now, let's calculate the total cost of his purchases before sales tax:

Cost of video game after discount: $44.10
Cost of new pair of shoes: $65
Total cost before sales tax: $44.10 + $65 = $109.10

Now, let's calculate the sales tax on the total cost of his purchases:

Sales tax (5% of $109.10): 0.05 * $109.10 = $5.455

Since sales tax is generally rounded to the nearest cent, we'll round $5.455 to $5.46.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of his purchases including sales tax:

Total cost before sales tax: $109.10
Sales tax: $5.46
Total cost including sales tax: $109.10 + $5.46 = $114.56

Finally, let's calculate how much money Tanner has left after his purchases:

Total saved: $145
Total cost including sales tax: $114.56
Money left: $145 - $114.56 = $30.44

Tanner has $30.44 left.","Tanner's earnings over the four months total $145. After his purchases, Tanner has $97 left.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Tanner spent:

Video game: $49
Shoes: $65

Total spending = $49 + $65 = $114

Tanner received a 10% discount on the video game, so let's calculate that discount:

Discount on video game = 10% of $49 = 0.10 * $49 = $4.90

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total spending:

Total spending after discount = $114 - $4.90 = $109.10

Tanner had to pay 5% sales tax on the total cost of his purchases, so let's calculate that tax:

176,"Tom purchased a football game at a 10% discount for its original price of $16. Apart from that, he bought a strategy game which was priced at $9.46 before a 5% sales tax was applied. Lastly, he got a Batman game for €11 (Euros). Assuming that the exchange rate is 1.15 USD per 1 EUR, how much did Tom spend on video games including the discounts, taxes, and currency conversion?","First, let's calculate the discounted price of the football game. 

The original price of the football game is $16, and it was purchased at a 10% discount. 

Discount on the football game = 10% of $16 = 0.10 * $16 = $1.60

Discounted price of the football game = Original price - Discount = $16 - $1.60 = $14.40

Next, let's calculate the final price of the strategy game including the sales tax.

Sales tax on the strategy game = 5% of $9.46 = 0.05 * $9.46 = $0.473

Final price of the strategy game = Original price + Sales tax = $9.46 + $0.473 = $9.933

Since we usually round to the nearest cent, the final price of the strategy game is $9.93.

Now, let's convert the price of the Batman game from Euros to USD.

Price of the Batman game in Euros = €11

Exchange rate = 1.15 USD per 1 EUR

Price of the Batman game in USD = €11 * 1.15 USD/EUR = $12.65

Finally, let's calculate the total amount spent on video games.

Total spent = Price of football game + Price of strategy game + Price of Batman game
Total spent = $14.40 + $9.93 + $12.65 = $36.98

Tom spent a total of $36.98 on video games including the discounts, taxes, and currency conversion.","Let's solve this step by step.

1. We first need to find the price of the football game after the 10% discount. $16 multiplied by 10% is $1.60. Subtracting this from the original price, we get $14.40 as the new price.

2. Next, we'll calculate the strategy game's price including the 5% sales tax. Multiplying $9.46 by 5% gives us $0.473, which we then add to the original price, resulting in a total of $9.933.

3. Converting the Batman game's price from Euros to USD, we multiply €11 by the exchange rate of 1.15 USD per 1 EUR, which gives us $12.65.

4. Adding up the prices, we find that Tom spent a total of $26.983 on video games.

So, the final answer is **Twenty Six Dollars and Ninety Eight Cents**.","First, let's calculate the discount Tom received on the football game. The discount is 10% of the original price, so:

10% of $16 = 0.10 * $16 = $1.60

Now, let's find out the discounted price of the football game:

$16 - $1.60 = $14.40

Next, let's calculate the sales tax on the strategy game. The sales tax is 5% of the price, so:

5% of $9.46 = 0.05 * $9.46 = $0.473

Now, let's find out the price of the strategy game after the sales tax:

$9.46 + $0.473 = $9.933

Since we can't have a fraction of a cent, we'll round the price to the nearest cent:

$9.933 ≈ $9.93

Now, let's convert the price of the Batman game from Euros to USD using the exchange rate of 1.15 USD per 1 EUR:

€11 * 1.15 USD per 1 EUR = $12.65

Now, let's add up all the amounts Tom spent:

$14.40 (discounted price of the football game) + $9.93 (price of the strategy game) + $12.65 (price of the Batman game) = $36.98

How many turnips did they grow in all?,"First, let's calculate the number of turnips Keith grows in a week. Since he grows 6 turnips every day, we multiply the number of turnips he grows per day by the number of days in a week:

Keith's turnips = 6 turnips/day * 7 days/week = 42 turnips

Next, let's calculate the number of turnips Alyssa grows in two weeks. Since she grows 9 turnips every two days, we need to find out how many two-day periods there are in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 14 days in two weeks. We divide the number of days by 2 to find the number of two-day periods:

Two-day periods in two weeks = 14 days / 2 days/period = 7 periods

Now we multiply the number of turnips Alyssa grows per two-day period by the number of periods:

Alyssa's turnips = 9 turnips/period * 7 periods = 63 turnips

Finally, we add the number of turnips Keith and Alyssa grew to find the total:

Total turnips = Keith's turnips + Alyssa's turnips
Total turnips = 42 turnips + 63 turnips = 105 turnips

Then, the total cost of the 3 pairs of shoes:
3 pairs of shoes * $95 each = $285

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total spent before buying the jeans:
Total spent = $270 (shirts) + $170 (pants) + $120 (jacket) + $285 (shoes)
Total spent = $845

He gave Mary 14 marbles, so he had:

After giving marbles to John, Dan had:

Dan then divided the remaining 22 marbles equally amongst his 4 friends. To find out how many marbles each friend received, we divide the remaining marbles by the number of friends:
22 / 4 = 5.5 marbles per friend.

Since Dan can't give half a marble to each friend, we need to adjust our calculation. It seems there might be a mistake because we can't divide 22 marbles equally among 4 friends without splitting marbles. However, if we assume that Dan can only give whole marbles, then each friend would receive 5 marbles, and there would be 2 marbles left over.","Dan initially had 64 marbles. 

He gave 14 to Mary, leaving him with 50.

She also offers discounts where if a customer buys at least ten gumballs, they get a 20% discount on the total cost, and if they buy at least twenty, it's a 30% decrease in price. 

If a customer buys 15 red gumballs, 18 green gumballs, and 22 yellow gumballs, how much will Melanie get from this specific sale?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the gumballs without any discounts.

For the red gumballs:
15 red gumballs x $0.08 each = $1.20

For the green gumballs:
18 green gumballs x $0.10 each = $1.80

For the yellow gumballs:
22 yellow gumballs x $0.12 each = $2.64

Now, let's add up the cost of all the gumballs:
$1.20 (red) + $1.80 (green) + $2.64 (yellow) = $5.64

Since the customer is buying a total of 55 gumballs (15 red + 18 green + 22 yellow), they qualify for the 30% discount because they are buying at least 20 gumballs.

Let's calculate the discount:
30% of $5.64 = 0.30 x $5.64 = $1.692

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Melanie will get from this sale:
$5.64 - $1.692 = $3.948

Since it's not common to charge fractions of a cent, Melanie would likely round this to the nearest cent. Therefore, Melanie will get $3.95 from this sale.","Melanie's earnings from this sale would be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the cost of each gumball type:
Red = 15 gumballs x 8 cents = $1.20
Green = 18 gumballs x 10 cents = $1.80
Yellow = 22 gumballs x 12 cents = $2.64

2. Total cost before the discount: $1.20 + $1.80 + $2.64 = $5.64

3. The customer has bought a total of 55 gumballs, so they'll receive a 30% discount.

4. Calculate the discount: 30% of $5.64 = 0.30 x $5.64 = $1.692

5. The final price the customer will pay is $5.64 - $1.692 = $3.948.

$3.95","First, let's calculate the total cost for each type of gumball before any discounts are applied:

Red gumballs: 15 gumballs * $0.08 each = $1.20
Green gumballs: 18 gumballs * $0.10 each = $1.80
Yellow gumballs: 22 gumballs * $0.12 each = $2.64

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the gumballs:

Total cost = $1.20 (red) + $1.80 (green) + $2.64 (yellow) = $5.64

Now, let's apply the discounts based on the total number of gumballs purchased:

If the customer buys at least ten gumballs, they get a 20% discount on the total cost. Since the customer has purchased 50 gumballs (15 red + 18 green + 22 yellow), they are eligible for the 20% discount.

Discount amount = 20% of $5.64 = 0.20 * $5.64 = $1.128

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount the customer will pay:

Final amount = Total cost - Discount amount = $5.64 - $1.128 = $4.512

Since Melanie is selling the gumballs for $0.08, $0.10, and $0.12 each, we need to convert the final amount to the number of gumballs she would give to the customer.

To do this, we divide the final amount by the cost per gumball for each type:

Red gumballs = Final amount / Cost per red gumball = $4.512 / $0.08 = 56.4 gumballs
Green gumballs = Final amount / Cost per green gumball = $4.512 / $0.10 = 45.12 gumballs
Yellow gumballs = Final amount / Cost per yellow gumball = $4.512 / $0.12 = 37.6 gumballs

Since we can't have a fraction of a gumball, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:

Red gumballs = 56
Green gumballs = 45
Yellow gumballs = 37

Now, let's calculate the total number of gumballs the customer will receive:

So, the total weight of the golf balls is approximately 22.05 kg.

Next, let's calculate the volume of one golf ball and then find the total volume for all 108 balls.

The radius of each golf ball is given in millimeters, so we need to convert it to centimeters before calculating the volume:
21.35 mm * (1 cm / 10 mm) = 2.135 cm

Now, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:
V = 4/3 * π * r³

For one golf ball, the volume is:
V = 4/3 * π * (2.135 cm)³
V ≈ 4/3 * π * (9.733225 cm³)
V ≈ 4/3 * π * 9.733225 cm³
V ≈ 4.18879 * 9.733225 cm³
V ≈ 40.766 cm³ (rounded to three decimal places)

Now, let's find the total volume for all 108 golf balls:
Total volume = 108 balls * 40.766 cm³/ball
Total volume ≈ 4402.728 cm³

Finally, let's convert the total volume to litres:
4402.728 cm³ * (1 litre / 1000 cm³) = 4.402728 litres

So, the total volume of all the golf balls is approximately 4.40 litres.","Sara has 9 dozen golf balls, which equals 9 x 12 = 108 golf balls.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the golf balls in pounds.
Weight in pounds = 108 balls x 0.45 pounds/ball = 48.6 pounds

Step 2: Convert the weight from pounds to kilograms.
Weight in kilograms = 48.6 pounds x 0.453592 kg/pound ≈ 22.00 kg

Step 3: Calculate the volume of one golf ball.
V = 4/3 * π * (21.35 mm)³ = 4388.89 mm³

Step 4: Calculate the total volume of all the golf balls.
Total volume = 4388.89 mm³ x 108 balls = 473,000 mm³

Step 5: Convert the volume from mm³ to litres.
Total volume in litres = 473,000 mm³ / 1000 cm³/litre ≈ 0.47 litres

The total volume of Sara's golf balls is approximately **0.47** litres.","First, let's calculate the total weight of the golf balls in kilograms.

Sara has 9 dozen golf balls, which is equivalent to 9 * 12 = 108 golf balls.

Each golf ball has a weight of 0.45 pounds. To convert this to kilograms, we use the conversion factor: 1 pound = 0.453592 kg.

So, the weight of one golf ball in kilograms is:
0.45 pounds * 0.453592 kg/pound = 0.203576 kg/golf ball

Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the golf balls:
Total weight = 0.203576 kg/golf ball * 108 golf balls = 22.08 kg

Next, let's calculate the volume of all the golf balls.

The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = 4/3 * π * r³, where V is the volume and r is the radius.

The radius of each golf ball is 21.35 mm. To calculate the volume of one golf ball, we use the formula:
Volume = 4/3 * π * (21.35 mm)³

First, we need to convert the radius from millimeters to meters:
Radius in meters = 21.35 mm * (1 meter / 1000 mm) = 0.02135 meters

Now, we can calculate the volume of one golf ball:
Volume of one golf ball = 4/3 * π * (0.02135 meters)³

To calculate the volume, we need the value of π. We can use the approximation π ≈ 3.14159.

Volume of one golf ball = 4/3 * 3.14159 * (0.02135 meters)³
Volume of one golf ball = 4/3 * 3.14159 * 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",0.47,22.08,4.40
184,"Fred had 7 dimes, 4 quarters, and 12 nickels in his bank. His sister borrowed 3 dimes and 2 quarters, and then returned 1 quarter and 5 nickels later on. Fred then found 50 cents broken into equal parts on the street, and added it to his bank. If each part is a fraction of a dime, how many dimes, quarters, and nickels does Fred have now?","Let's calculate step by step:

1. Fred originally had:
- Dimes: 7
- Quarters: 4
- Nickels: 12

2. His sister borrowed 3 dimes and 2 quarters:
- Dimes after borrowing: 7 - 3 = 4
- Quarters after borrowing: 4 - 2 = 2
- Nickels remain the same: 12

3. His sister returned 1 quarter and 5 nickels:
- Dimes remain the same: 4
- Quarters after returning: 2 + 1 = 3
- Nickels after returning: 12 + 5 = 17

4. Fred found 50 cents broken into equal parts on the street. Since each part is a fraction of a dime, and a dime is worth 10 cents, we need to find out how many dimes make up 50 cents:
- 50 cents / 10 cents per dime = 5 dimes

5. Adding the found dimes to his bank:
- Dimes after adding: 4 + 5 = 9
- Quarters remain the same: 3
- Nickels remain the same: 17

So, Fred now has:
- Dimes: 9
- Quarters: 3
- Nickels: 17","Fred initially had 7 dimes, 4 quarters, and 12 nickels. His sister borrowed 3 dimes and one quarter, leaving Fred with 4 dimes and 3 quarters. She then returned 5 nickels and one quarter, giving Fred 9 nickels and 4 quarters. 

Fred then found two 25-cent pieces on the street, which he converted into 10 nickels. 

So, after all these transactions, Fred has 4 dimes, 4 quarters, and 19 nickels.

Peace.","Let's calculate the amount of money Fred has in each type of coin after each event:

1. Initially, Fred has:
   - 7 dimes
   - 4 quarters
   - 12 nickels

2. His sister borrows:
   - 3 dimes
   - 2 quarters

3. She returns:
   - 1 quarter
   - 5 nickels

4. Fred finds 50 cents on the street and adds it to his bank. Since each part is a fraction of a dime, we need to find out how many dimes 50 cents is worth.

First, we need to convert 50 cents into dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so 50 cents is equal to 50/100 = 0.5 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how many dimes 0.5 dollars is worth. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, we divide 0.5 dollars by 10 cents per dime:

0.5 dollars ÷ 10 cents per dime = 0.5 ÷ 10 = 0.05 dimes

So, Fred has 0.05 dimes from the 50 cents he found.

Now, let's calculate the new amounts of each type of coin:

- Dimes: 7 - 3 = 4 dimes (after his sister borrows)
- Quarters: 4 - 2 = 2 quarters (after his sister borrows)
- Nickels: 12 - 5 = 7 nickels (after his sister returns)

After adding the 0.05 dimes from the 50 cents:

- Dimes: 4 + 0.05 = 4.05 dimes

Now, let's round the number of dimes to the nearest whole number, since we can't have a fraction of a dime:

- Dimes: 4.05 dimes ≈ 4 dimes

So, Fred now has:

- 4 dimes
- 2 quarters
- 7 nickels

Therefore, Fred now has 4 dimes, 2 quarters, and 7 nickels.",19,7 nickels,9 quarters.

For Type A stamps, the cost will be:
4 stamps * 34 cents = 136 cents

For Type B stamps, the cost will be:
6 stamps * 52 cents = 312 cents

For Type C stamps, the cost will be:
2 stamps * 73 cents = 146 cents

Now, we add all the costs together:
136 cents (Type A) + 312 cents (Type B) + 146 cents (Type C) = 594 cents

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we can convert 594 cents to dollars:

Total cost for Type A stamps = Cost per stamp * Number of stamps
Total cost for Type A stamps = 34 cents * 4
Total cost for Type A stamps = 136 cents

For Type B stamps:
Cost per stamp = 52 cents
Number of stamps = 6
Total cost for Type B stamps = Cost per stamp * Number of stamps
Total cost for Type B stamps = 52 cents * 6
Total cost for Type B stamps = 312 cents

For Type C stamps:
Cost per stamp = 73 cents

194,"Joan picked 790 apples from the orchard. She gave 3/7 of the apples to Melanie, ate 25 herself and sold 180 at the market. The remaining apples were divided equally among 4 baskets. How many apples are in each basket?","First, let's find out how many apples Joan gave to Melanie. She gave away 3/7 of the total 790 apples she picked.

3/7 of 790 = (3/7) * 790
= 3 * (790 / 7)
= 3 * 113
= 339 apples

Now, let's subtract the apples given to Melanie, the ones she ate, and the ones sold at the market from the total number of apples Joan picked.

Total apples after giving to Melanie: 790 - 339 = 451 apples
After eating 25 herself: 451 - 25 = 426 apples
After selling 180 at the market: 426 - 180 = 246 apples

Now, Joan has 246 apples left, which she divides equally among 4 baskets.

246 apples / 4 baskets = 61.5 apples per basket

Since we can't have half an apple in a basket, we need to check our calculations as there might be a mistake because the number of apples in each basket should be a whole number.

Let's go through the calculations again:

Joan initially picked 790 apples.
She gave Melanie 3/7 of the apples: 3/7 * 790 = 339 apples.
She ate 25 apples herself.
She sold 180 apples at the market.

Now, let's subtract all these from the total:

790 - 339 (Melanie's share) - 25 (eaten) - 180 (sold) = 790 - 339 - 25 - 180
= 790 - 544
= 246 apples remaining

Now, these 246 apples are divided equally among 4 baskets:

246 apples / 4 baskets = 61.5 apples per basket

It seems there is indeed a mistake because we cannot have half an apple in a basket. Let's recheck the division:

246 apples / 4 baskets = 61 apples per basket

Now we have a whole number of apples per basket, which means each of the 4 baskets will have 61 apples.","Joan initially picked 790 apples. She gave 3/7 x 790 = 345 apples to Melanie. After that, 790 - 345 = 445 apples were left. 
Joan then ate 25 apples, so there were only 445 - 25 = 420 apples left. 
The next step was selling some of them, which resulted in 420 - 180 = 240 apples remaining.
Finally, dividing the remaining apples equally among the 4 baskets results in each basket having 240 / 4 = 60 apples.

**60**","First, let's calculate how many apples Joan gave to Melanie:
3/7 of 790 apples = (3/7) * 790 = 390 apples

Next, let's find out how many apples Joan has left after giving some to Melanie:
790 apples - 390 apples = 400 apples

Now, let's subtract the apples Joan ate and sold from the remaining apples:
400 apples - 25 apples (ate) - 180 apples (sold) = 195 apples

Finally, let's divide the remaining apples equally among the 4 baskets:
195 apples ÷ 4 baskets = 48.75 apples per basket

Since we can't have a fraction of an apple in a basket, we'll have to round to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round down to 48 apples per basket.",60,48,61

Babysitting earnings = $35/day * 5 days = $175

For pet care, she earns $60 per day. She took care of pets for 3 days, so:
Pet care earnings = $60/day * 3 days = $180

Now, we add all her earnings together:

Now, let's find out how many cards are in the new pack Mike buys.

The pack consists of 2 rare cards.
It also has 5 times the number of rare cards as regular cards. Since there are 2 rare cards, there are 5 * 2 = 10 regular cards in the pack.

So, the total number of cards in the new pack is 2 rare cards + 10 regular cards = 12 cards.

To find the percentage of rare cards in the pack, we use the formula:

( Number of rare cards / Total number of cards ) * 100%

139 - 32 = 107 turnips left.

David had 87 turnips and sold 15, so he has:
87 - 15 = 72 turnips left.

Now, let's add the turnips that Benny and Sarah have to the remaining turnips of Melanie and David:

Benny's turnips: 113
Sarah's turnips: 195
Melanie's remaining turnips: 107
David's remaining turnips: 72

Total turnips after selling some = 113 + 195 + 107 + 72

Benny has 113 turnips.
Sarah has 195 turnips.
David has 87 - 15 = 72 turnips after selling some.
Altogether, they have 107 + 113 + 195 + 72 = 497 turnips. 

Four hundred and ninety-seven.","Melanie started with 139 turnips and sold 32, so she has:

Sarah started with 195 turnips and did not sell any, so she has:
195 - 0 = 195 turnips left.

David started with 87 turnips and sold 15, so he has:
87 - 15 = 72 turnips left.

Now, let's add up the turnips they have left:
Melanie's turnips left + Benny's turnips left + Sarah's turnips left + David's turnips left = 107 + 113 + 195 + 72 = 587 turnips.

Since Mary has 4 times more black balloons than Nancy, and Nancy has 7 black balloons, we multiply 7 by 4 to get the number of black balloons Mary has:

Mary's black balloons = 7 * 4 = 28

Now, let's find the total number of black balloons that Mary and Nancy have combined:

Total of Mary and Nancy's black balloons = Nancy's black balloons + Mary's black balloons
Total = 7 (Nancy's) + 28 (Mary's) = 35

Finally, we need to find out how many black balloons Jack has. Since Jack has 3 more black balloons than the total of Mary and Nancy's black balloons, we add 3 to the combined total:

Jack's black balloons = Total of Mary and Nancy's black balloons + 3
Jack's black balloons = 35 + 3 = 38

For peaches:
He had 34 peaches and now has 86.
86 peaches - 34 peaches = 52 peaches picked.

For apples:
He had 15 apples and now has 45.
45 apples - 15 apples = 30 apples picked.

Park workers will plant 41 more dogwood trees today, which, on average, grow by 2 trees per year, and 20 more dogwood trees tomorrow, which, on average, grow by 4 trees per year. Calculate the total number of dogwood trees expected in the park after 5 years.","Let's calculate the total number of dogwood trees expected in the park after 5 years step by step.

First, we'll calculate the number of trees that will be added today and tomorrow:

Today: 41 dogwood trees
Tomorrow: 20 dogwood trees

Now, let's calculate the growth of each group of trees over 5 years:

Today's trees (41 trees) grow by 2 trees per year:
Growth over 5 years = 2 trees/year * 5 years = 10 trees
So, after 5 years, today's trees will have added 10 trees to the original 41, making a total of 41 + 10 = 51 trees.

Tomorrow's trees (20 trees) grow by 4 trees per year:
Growth over 5 years = 4 trees/year * 5 years = 20 trees
So, after 5 years, tomorrow's trees will have added 20 trees to the original 20, making a total of 20 + 20 = 40 trees.

Now, let's add the original number of trees, the trees planted today, and the trees planted tomorrow, along with their respective growths:

Original trees: 39
Today's trees after 5 years: 51
Tomorrow's trees after 5 years: 40

Total number of dogwood trees expected in the park after 5 years:
39 (original) + 51 (today's trees after growth) + 40 (tomorrow's trees after growth) = 39 + 51 + 40 = 130

Therefore, the total number of dogwood trees expected in the park after 5 years is 130.","We start with 39 dogwood trees and add 41 today and another 20 tomorrow. So after today, there will be 80 dogwood trees in the park.

Assuming each tree's growth rate stays constant, after one year, the number of trees will be:
80 + 2 + 4 = 86

After two years:
86 + 4 + 8 = 98

After three years:
98 + 6 + 12 = 116

After four years:
116 + 8 + 16 = 140

And finally, after five years:
140 + 10 + 20 = 170

Therefore, the total number of dogwood trees expected in the park after five years is **one hundred and seventy**.","First, let's calculate the total number of dogwood trees expected after planting today and tomorrow.

Today, 41 more dogwood trees will be planted, so the total number of dogwood trees will be:
39 (current number of trees) + 41 (trees to be planted today) = 80 trees

Tomorrow, 20 more dogwood trees will be planted, so the total number of dogwood trees will be:
80 (current number of trees) + 20 (trees to be planted tomorrow) = 100 trees

Now, let's calculate the expected number of dogwood trees after 5 years, taking into account the growth rate of the trees.

For the trees planted today, we expect them to grow by 2 trees per year, so after 5 years, they will have grown by:
2 trees/year * 5 years = 10 trees

For the trees planted tomorrow, we expect them to grow by 4 trees per year, so after 5 years, they will have grown by:
4 trees/year * 5 years = 20 trees

Now, let's add the growth of both sets of trees to the current number of trees:
100 (current number of trees) + 10 (growth of trees planted today) + 20 (growth of trees planted tomorrow) = 130 trees

Vivian: 45 books
Tim: 22 books
Mike: 20 books
Lucy: 33 books

Total = 45 + 22 + 20 + 33 = 120 books

b) To find the difference between the highest and the lowest number of books, we identify the highest number of books and the lowest number of books and then subtract the lowest from the highest:

Highest number of books: Vivian with 45 books
Lowest number of books: Mike with 20 books

Difference = 45 - 20 = 25 books

c) To calculate the sum of books owned by Vivian and Lucy only, we add the number of books each of them has:

Vivian: 45 books
Lucy: 33 books

Sum = 45 + 33 = 78 books

d) To find the average number of books each person owns, we take the total number of books and divide it by the number of people:

Total number of books = 120 (from part a)

Average = Total number of books / Number of people
Average = 120 / 4 = 30 books per person","Let's solve the problem you have described:

a) The total number of books is calculated by summing up the books each person has. We have:

They have a total of 120 books together.

b) The highest number of books is Vivian's 45, and the lowest is Mike's 20. 
The difference between them is 45 - 20 = 25 books.

c) We need to find the sum of books owned by Vivian and Lucy. 
It's 45 (Vivian's books) + 33 (Lucy's books) = 78 books.

d) To find the average number of books each person owns, we divide the total number of books by the number of people:

Now, let's calculate the arrival time on the final day (Saturday, Week 5). We need to consider the flight time and the stopover time.

Flight time for Saturday, Week 5:
- 1460 miles / 500 mph = 2.92 hours

Since the pilot starts at 8:00 am, we need to add the flight time and the stopover time to this starting time.

Stopover time for Saturday, Week 5:

- Stopover time: 3 hours and 30 minutes

Total time from 8:00 am:
- 8:00 am + 2 hours and 55 minutes = 10:55 am

- Friday (5% discount): 16 pies * $5 * (1 - 0.05) = 16 pies * $5 * 0.95 = $76
- Saturday: 20 pies * $5 = $100
- Sunday: 11 pies * $5 = $55

Now, let's sum up the revenue for each day to get the total revenue for the week:

Total revenue = $45 + $60 + $81 + $70 + $76 + $100 + $55 = $487

The total revenue generated from selling pies during the week is $487.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1: Calculate the total number of pies sold Monday through Tuesday, Monday being 9 pies and Tuesday 12, totaling 21 pies. 

2: Wednesday is 18 pies, Thursday 14, and Friday 16. That's 48 pies over the three days. 

3: The weekend sales are 20 pies on Saturday and 11 on Sunday, a total of 31 pies. So, the total number of pies sold during the week is 21 + 48 + 31 = 100 pies.

4: The normal revenue for 100 pies is $500 because 100 x $5 = $500.

5: Wednesday's discount means each pie costs $4.50 instead of $5, so the revenue for the day is $81 instead of $90.

6: Friday's discount makes each pie $4.75 to account for the 5% off the $5 price. The revenue for Friday is thus $75.75.

7: Adding the revenue from each day: $90 + $94.50 + $81 + $75.75 + ($5 * 20) + $55 = $466.25.

Therefore, the total revenue for the week is **$466.25**.","First, let's calculate the revenue from each day without the discounts:

Monday: 9 pies * $5/pie = $45
Tuesday: 12 pies * $5/pie = $60
Wednesday: 18 pies * $5/pie = $90
Thursday: 14 pies * $5/pie = $70
Friday: 16 pies * $5/pie = $80
Saturday: 20 pies * $5/pie = $100
Sunday: 11 pies * $5/pie = $55

Now, let's calculate the revenue from each day with the discounts:

Wednesday (10% discount): 18 pies * $5/pie * 90% = $81
Friday (5% discount): 16 pies * $5/pie * 95% = $76

Now, let's add up the revenue from each day:

Monday: $45
Tuesday: $60
Wednesday: $81
Thursday: $70
Friday: $76
Saturday: $100
Sunday: $55

Total revenue for the week: $45 + $60 + $81 + $70 + $76 + $100 + $55 = $497

218,"Mike decided to buy some toys for his younger siblings. He bought 15 marbles for $9.05, a football for $4.95, and spent $6.52 on a baseball. He also saw a toy car on sale for $10.99 which was 15% off its original price and a doll for $12.50 with a buy-one-get-one 20% off offer. If he took advantage of both offers and bought two dolls, how much did Mike spend in total on all the toys?","First, let's calculate the cost of the toy car with the 15% discount.

The original price of the toy car is $10.99. To find the discount, we calculate 15% of $10.99:

$10.99 * 15/100 = $1.6485

Since we usually don't deal with fractions of a cent, we'll round this to the nearest cent, which is $1.65.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of the toy car:

$10.99 - $1.65 = $9.34

Next, let's calculate the cost of two dolls with the buy-one-get-one 20% off offer. The first doll is $12.50, and the second doll will have a 20% discount.

20% of $12.50 is:

$12.50 * 20/100 = $2.50

So, the second doll will cost:

$12.50 - $2.50 = $10.00

Now, let's add the cost of two dolls together:

$12.50 (first doll) + $10.00 (second doll) = $22.50

Finally, let's add up the cost of all the toys Mike bought:

Marbles: $9.05
Football: $4.95
Baseball: $6.52
Toy car (with discount): $9.34
Two dolls (with offer): $22.50

Total cost = $9.05 + $4.95 + $6.52 + $9.34 + $22.50 = $52.36

So, Mike spent a total of $52.36 on all the toys.","Mike's toy shopping trip involved a lot of careful consideration and some smart shopping strategies. Let's break down his expenses:

1. Marbles: $9.05
2. Football: $4.95
3. Baseball: $6.52
4. Toy car: The car's original price was $10.99, and with a 15% discount, Mike paid $9.34.
5. Dolls: Two dolls at $12.50 each, with a buy-one-get-one 20% off deal, resulted in a total of $21.00 for both.

Mike's total expenses for the day: $50.85.

So, the final result is Fifty dollars and eighty-five cents ($50.85).","First, let's calculate the original price of the toy car before the 15% discount:

Original price of toy car = $10.99
Discount = 15% of $10.99
Discount = 0.15 * $10.99
Discount = $1.6485
Discounted price of toy car = $10.99 - $1.6485
Discounted price of toy car = $9.3415

Now, let's calculate the price of the doll after the buy-one-get-one 20% off offer:

Price of one doll = $12.50
Discount = 20% of $12.50
Discount = 0.20 * $12.50
Discount = $2.50
Price of one doll after discount = $12.50 - $2.50
Price of one doll after discount = $10.00

Since Mike took advantage of the buy-one-get-one offer, he bought two dolls:

Price of two dolls = 2 * $10.00
Price of two dolls = $20.00

Now, let's add up all the prices to find the total amount Mike spent:

Total amount spent = $9.05 (marbles) + $4.95 (football) + $6.52 (baseball) + $9.3415 (toy car) + $20.00 (two dolls)
Total amount spent = $9.05 + $4.95 + $6.52 + $9.3415 + $20.00
Total amount spent = $40.8615

222,"A powerful dust storm descends upon the prairie and travels at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. Over the course of four hours, the direction of the storm changes, causing different areas to be affected. During the first two hours, the storm passes through Zone A at a speed of 45 miles per hour, covering 80% of a region that measures 55,000 acres. In the next hour, the speed of the storm increases to 60 miles per hour and moves through Zone B. This time, only 60% of a 35,000-acre area is covered in dust. Finally, in the remaining hour, the dust storm slows down to 40 miles per hour and engulfs 95% of Zone C, which is 45,000 acres large. Additionally, there is a total of 1,500 acres unaffected by the dust storm across all three zones. Calculate the total area of the prairie, taking into account the different zones and the portion of land unaffected by the storm in each case.","To calculate the total area of the prairie, we need to consider the portions of each zone that were affected by the dust storm and add the unaffected acreage.

First, let's calculate the affected areas in each zone:

Zone A:
80% of Zone A is covered by the dust storm.
Affected area in Zone A = 80% of 55,000 acres = 0.80 * 55,000 acres = 44,000 acres

Zone B:
60% of Zone B is covered by the dust storm.
Affected area in Zone B = 60% of 35,000 acres = 0.60 * 35,000 acres = 21,000 acres

Zone C:
95% of Zone C is covered by the dust storm.
Affected area in Zone C = 95% of 45,000 acres = 0.95 * 45,000 acres = 42,750 acres

Now, let's add the unaffected acreage to the total:

Unaffected acreage across all zones = 1,500 acres

Total affected area = Affected area in Zone A + Affected area in Zone B + Affected area in Zone C
Total affected area = 44,000 acres + 21,000 acres + 42,750 acres
Total affected area = 107,750 acres

Total area of the prairie = Total affected area + Unaffected acreage
Total area of the prairie = 107,750 acres + 1,500 acres
Total area of the prairie = 109,250 acres

Therefore, the total area of the prairie, including all zones and the unaffected land, is 109,250 acres.","To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of each zone that was affected by the dust storm during the four hours it was active.

Zone A:
Speed = 45 mph
Time = 2 hours
Area covered = 80% of 55,000 acres = 44,000 acres

Zone B:
Speed = 60 mph
Time = 1 hour
Area covered = 60% of 35,000 acres = 21,000 acres

Zone C:
Speed = 40 mph
Time = 1 hour
Area covered = 95% of 45,000 acres = 42,750 acres

Now, we'll subtract the unaffected areas from each zone:
Zone A - 44,000 - 15% of 55,000 acres = 37,900 acres
Zone B - 21,000 - 40% of 35,000 acres = 14,700 acres
Zone C - 42,750 - 5% of 45,000 acres = 40,575 acres

Adding up the affected areas of the three zones and then subtracting the unaffected area gives us:
(37,900 + 14,700 + 40,575) acres - 1,500 acres = 92,175 acres - 1,500 acres = 90,675 acres

The prairie's total area is 90,675 acres.

90,675","Let's calculate the area covered by the dust storm in each zone:

Zone A:
In the first two hours, the storm covers 80% of a 55,000-acre region. To find the area covered, we multiply the percentage by the total area:
80% of 55,000 acres = 0.80 * 55,000 acres = 44,000 acres

Zone B:
In the next hour, the storm covers 60% of a 35,000-acre region. To find the area covered, we multiply the percentage by the total area:
60% of 35,000 acres = 0.60 * 35,000 acres = 21,000 acres

Zone C:
In the remaining hour, the storm covers 95% of a 45,000-acre region. To find the area covered, we multiply the percentage by the total area:

So, the number of visitors on Saturday is:
1250 visitors (Friday) * 300% = 1250 * 3 = 3750 visitors

Now, on Sunday, there was a decrease of 15% compared to the number of visitors on Saturday.

To find the decrease in the number of visitors, we calculate 15% of the number of visitors on Saturday:
15% of 3750 visitors = 0.15 * 3750 = 562.5 visitors

Since there was a decrease, we subtract this number from the number of visitors on Saturday to find the number of visitors on Sunday:
3750 visitors (Saturday) - 562.5 visitors (decrease) = 3187.5 visitors

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a visitor, we'll round the number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, approximately 3188 people visited the zoo on Sunday.","Let's call the number of visitors on Friday as $1250. On Saturday, the zoo saw 1250 * 3 = 3750 visitors. 
Next, a 15% decrease in this number on Sunday results in a decrease of 3750 * 0.15 = 562.5 visitors. This means that 3750 - 562.5 = 3187.5 people visited the zoo on Sunday.

**3188**","On Saturday, the number of visitors increased by 300% compared to Friday. This means that the number of visitors on Saturday was 1300% of the number of visitors on Friday. To find this, we multiply the number of visitors on Friday by 1300%:

1250 visitors on Friday * 1300% = 1250 * 1.3 = 1625 visitors on Saturday

On Sunday, there was a decrease of 15% compared to the number of visitors on Saturday. To find the number of visitors on Sunday, we subtract 15% of the number of visitors on Saturday from the number of visitors on Saturday:

1625 visitors on Saturday - (15% of 1625) = 1625 - (0.15 * 1625) = 1625 - 243.75 = 1381.25

Since the number of visitors on Sunday cannot be a fraction, we round to the nearest whole number. The number of visitors on Sunday is approximately 1381 people.",3188,1381,3188
229,There are 4 dozen calories in a candy bar. How many kilocalories are there in 576 candy bars ?,"First, let's determine how many calories are in one candy bar. Since there are 4 dozen calories in a candy bar, and one dozen equals 12, we multiply 4 by 12 to find the number of calories in one candy bar:

4 dozen x 12 = 48 calories per candy bar

Now, to find out how many calories are in 576 candy bars, we multiply the number of calories in one candy bar by the number of candy bars:

48 calories/bar x 576 bars = 27,648 calories

Since 1 kilocalorie (kcal) is equal to 1,000 calories, we divide the total number of calories by 1,000 to convert calories to kilocalories:

27,648 calories / 1,000 = 27.648 kilocalories

Therefore, there are 27.648 kilocalories in 576 candy bars.","There are 48 calories in one candy bar, so 48 x 576 = 2784 calories in 576 candy bars. 

One dozen is 12 items, so 4 x 12 = 48 candy bars in one dozen. 576 candy bars equal 576 / 48 = 12 dozens.

2784 calories x 1000 (to convert to kilocalories) = 2,784,000 kilocalories.

The result is two million seven hundred and eighty-four thousand.","First, let's find out how many calories are in one candy bar. Since there are 4 dozen calories in one candy bar, we can divide 4 dozen by 12 (since there are 12 candy bars in a dozen) to find out how many calories are in one candy bar:

4 dozen / 12 candy bars per dozen = 0.3333... candy bars per dozen

Now, let's convert this to a whole number by multiplying by 1000 (since there are 1000 millicandies in a candy bar):

0.3333... * 1000 = 333.33... millicandies per candy bar

Now, let's convert this to a whole number by rounding to the nearest whole number:

333.33... ≈ 333 millicandies per candy bar

Now, let's find out how many millicandies are in 576 candy bars:

576 candy bars * 333 millicandies per candy bar = 192,048 millicandies

Since there are 1000 millicandies in a kilocalorie, we can divide 192,048 millicandies by 1000 to find out how many kilocalories there are in 576 candy bars:

192,048 millicandies / 1000 millicandies per kilocalorie = 192.048 kilocalories

Now, let's round this to the nearest whole number:

192.048 ≈ 192 kilocalories

231,"On Saturday, Sara spent $10.62 each on 2 tickets to a movie theater with a 10% discount available for students, which she is eligible for. She also rented a movie for $1.59, bought a movie for $13.95, and purchased snacks for $7.50. In addition, she needs to pay a sales tax of 5% on the movie theater tickets, rented movie, and purchased movie. How much money in total did Sara spend on movies and snacks?","First, let's calculate the cost of the movie theater tickets with the student discount:

The original price for two tickets is $10.62 each, so for two tickets it would be:
2 tickets * $10.62 = $21.24

Now, we apply the 10% student discount to the total cost of the tickets:
10% of $21.24 is $21.24 * 0.10 = $2.124

So the discount amount is $2.124, and we subtract that from the original price of the tickets:
$21.24 - $2.124 = $19.116

Since we can't have a fraction of a cent, we'll round this to the nearest cent, which is $19.12.

Next, we need to calculate the sales tax for the movie theater tickets, rented movie, and purchased movie. The sales tax is 5%.

First, let's add the cost of the rented movie and the purchased movie to the discounted movie theater tickets:
$19.12 (discounted tickets) + $1.59 (rented movie) + $13.95 (purchased movie) = $34.66

Now, we calculate the 5% sales tax on this amount:
5% of $34.66 is $34.66 * 0.05 = $1.733

Rounded to the nearest cent, the sales tax is $1.73.

Now, let's add the sales tax to the subtotal:
$34.66 (subtotal) + $1.73 (sales tax) = $36.39

Finally, we add the cost of the snacks, which do not have sales tax:
$36.39 (subtotal with sales tax) + $7.50 (snacks) = $43.89

Therefore, Sara spent a total of $43.89 on movies and snacks.","Sara spent $24.24 at the movie theater.

She received a 10% discount on the tickets, so 10% * $10.62 = $1.06 saved. With the discount applied, each ticket now costs $9.56.
The sales tax for the two tickets is 5% * $9.56 * 2 = $0.91.
Adding the cost of the other purchases: $9.56 + $0.91 + $1.59 + $13.95 + $7.50 = $24.24.

Fun at the movies!","First, let's calculate the discount Sara received on her movie theater tickets. Since she is eligible for a 10% discount, we multiply the cost of each ticket by 10% to find the discount:

Discount per ticket = $10.62 * 10% = $1.062

Now, let's subtract the discount from the cost of each ticket to find the amount she paid after the discount:

Amount paid per ticket = $10.62 - $1.062 = $9.56

Sara bought 2 tickets, so the total amount she paid for the tickets after the discount is:

Total amount paid for tickets = $9.56 * 2 = $19.12

Next, we need to calculate the sales tax on the movie theater tickets, rented movie, and purchased movie. The sales tax is 5% of the total cost of these items:

Sales tax = 5% of ($19.12 + $1.59 + $13.95)
Sales tax = 5% of ($22.66)
Sales tax = 0.05 * $22.66
Sales tax = $1.133

Now, let's add the sales tax to the total amount paid for the tickets to find the total cost for the tickets:

Total cost for tickets = $19.12 + $1.133
Total cost for tickets = $20.253

Since Sara also rented a movie for $1.59 and bought a movie for $13.95, we add these amounts to the total cost for the tickets to find the total cost for the movies:

Total cost for movies = $20.253 + $1.59 + $13.95
Total cost for movies = $20.253 + $15.54
Total cost for movies = $35.793

Finally, we add the cost of the snacks to the total cost for the movies to find the total amount Sara spent on movies and snacks:

Total amount spent = $35.793 + $7.50
Total amount spent = $43.293

Therefore, Sara spent a total of $43.293 on movies and snacks.",24.24,43.293,forty three dollars and ninety nine cents

5. Board game: $23.47

Total cost before discount = $8.25 + $6.59 + $12.10 + $15.29 + $23.47

Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

Discount = 10% of total cost
Discount = 0.10 * (Total cost before discount)

After applying the discount, the new total cost will be:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount

Finally, we need to add the 6% sales tax to the total cost after discount to get the final amount Alyssa spent:

Sales tax = 6% of total cost after discount
Sales tax = 0.06 * (Total cost after discount)

Total amount spent = Total cost after discount + Sales tax

Let's do the calculations:

Total cost before discount = $8.25 + $6.59 + $12.10 + $15.29 + $23.47
Total cost before discount = $65.70

Discount = 0.10 * $65.70
Discount = $6.57

Total cost after discount = $65.70 - $6.57
Total cost after discount = $59.13

Sales tax = 0.06 * $59.13
Sales tax = $3.55

Total amount spent = $59.13 + $3.55
Total amount spent = $62.68

Alyssa spent a total of $62.68 on toys after applying the discount coupon and including sales tax.","Alyssa's total shopping bill comes to $55.80 without the discount.

We can then calculate the sales tax by multiplying the discounted total by 0.06: $50.22 × 0.06 = $3.01. 

Adding the sales tax to the discounted total gives us a final cost of $50.22 + $3.01 = $53.23.

It is known that 1 full-time equivalent equals 40 weekly hours. Calculate the total number of employees in the corporation by converting all workers to weekly hours and rounding the result to the nearest whole number.","To calculate the total number of employees in the corporation, we need to convert all workers to weekly hours and then convert those hours back to the number of full-time equivalent employees.

First, let's convert the full-time, remote, and temporary staff members to weekly hours using the fact that 1 full-time equivalent equals 40 weekly hours.

Full-time employees:
63,093 full-time employees * 40 hours/employee = 2,523,720 hours

Remote workers:
5,230 remote workers * 40 hours/worker = 209,200 hours

Temporary staff members:
8,597 temporary staff members * 40 hours/staff member = 343,880 hours

Now, let's add the part-time employees' weekly hours to this total:

Total weekly hours for all employees:
2,523,720 hours (full-time) + 209,200 hours (remote) + 343,880 hours (temporary) + 2,041 hours (part-time) = 3,078,841 hours

Now, we convert the total weekly hours back to the number of full-time equivalent employees by dividing by 40 hours per full-time equivalent:

3,078,841 hours / 40 hours/full-time equivalent = 76,971.025 full-time equivalents

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:

76,971 full-time equivalent employees

Therefore, the total number of employees in the corporation, when converted to full-time equivalents, is approximately 76,971.","We are asked to calculate the total number of employees in a corporation by converting all employees' work arrangements into weekly hours. We are given that 1 full-time equivalent (FTE) equals 40 weekly hours.

1. First, let's calculate the weekly hours from part-time employees. 2,041 part-time employees work an average of 24 hours per week (this is a made-up average to reflect the nature of part-time work). Weekly hours: 2,041 x 24 = 48,984 hours.

2. Next, we'll convert FTEs to weekly hours for the other categories. 

   - Full-time employees: 63,093 x 40 hours = 2,523,720 hours
   - Remote workers: 5,230 x 40 hours = 209,200 hours.
   - Temporary staff: 8,597 x 40 hours = 343,880 hours.

Since Jason can't have a fraction of a shelf, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. So, he will need 6 shelves for his regular-sized books.

Next, let's calculate how many shelves Jason will need for his large-sized books. He has 75 large-sized books, and each shelf can hold 30 large-sized books. So, we divide the total number of large-sized books by the number of books each shelf can hold:

75 large-sized books / 30 books per shelf = 2.5 shelves

Again, since Jason can't have a fraction of a shelf, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. So, he will need 3 shelves for his large-sized books.

Now, let's add the number of shelves needed for both types of books:

6 shelves (for regular-sized books) + 3 shelves (for large-sized books) = 9 shelves

Therefore, Jason will need a total of 9 shelves to store all of his books.","Jason has:
240 regular-sized books / 45 books per shelf = 5.33 shelves
75 large-sized books / 30 books per shelf = 2.5 shelves

Adding these together, Jason needs 8 shelves to store all his books.

The final result is eight.","First, let's find out how many regular-sized books Jason can store on one shelf:
45 regular-sized books per shelf

Now, let's find out how many large-sized books Jason can store on one shelf:
30 large-sized books per shelf

Next, let's calculate how many shelves Jason will need for his regular-sized books:
240 regular-sized books ÷ 45 regular-sized books per shelf = 5 shelves

Now, let's calculate how many shelves Jason will need for his large-sized books:
75 large-sized books ÷ 30 large-sized books per shelf = 2.5 shelves

Since Jason can't have a fraction of a shelf, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jason will need 3 shelves for his large-sized books.

Finally, let's add the number of shelves for both types of books to find the total number of shelves Jason will need:
5 shelves for regular-sized books + 3 shelves for large-sized books = 8 shelves

Jason will need 8 shelves to store all of his books.",eight,eight,9
240,"Sandy went to the mall to buy clothes during a sale with a 10% discount on all items. She spent $13.99 on shorts, $12.14 on a shirt, $7.43 on a jacket, $8.50 on a pair of shoes, and $10.75 on accessories. Additionally, she had a $5.00 coupon to use and there's a 7.5% sales tax. How much money did Sandy spend on clothes after applying the discounts, coupon, and adding the tax?","First, let's calculate the total amount Sandy spent before the discounts and coupon:

Shorts: $13.99
Shirt: $12.14
Jacket: $7.43
Shoes: $8.50
Accessories: $10.75

Total before discounts and coupon = $13.99 + $12.14 + $7.43 + $8.50 + $10.75 = $52.81

Now, let's apply the 10% discount on all items. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total by 10% (or 0.10):

Discount amount = $52.81 * 0.10 = $5.281

Total after discount = Total before discounts - Discount amount
Total after discount = $52.81 - $5.281 = $47.529 (rounded to $47.53)

Next, we apply the $5.00 coupon:

Total after coupon = Total after discount - Coupon
Total after coupon = $47.53 - $5.00 = $42.53

Finally, we need to add the 7.5% sales tax to the total after the coupon. To find the tax amount, we multiply the total by 7.5% (or 0.075):

Tax amount = $42.53 * 0.075 = $3.18975

Total after tax = Total after coupon + Tax amount
Total after tax = $42.53 + $3.18975 = $45.71975 (rounded to $45.72)

So, Sandy spent $45.72 on clothes after applying the discounts, coupon, and adding the tax.","Sandy's shopping trip involved several discounted prices and a coupon, so let's break down the costs and calculate the total:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before any discounts or tax:
Shorts: $13.99
Shirt: $12.14
Jacket: $7.43
Shoes: $8.50
Accessories: $10.75
Total before discounts: $42.77

2. Apply the 10% discount on all items:
10% of $42.77 = 42.77 x 10/100 = $4.28
New total after 10% discount: $38.49

3. Subtract the coupon amount:
$38.49 - $5.00 = $33.49

4. Calculate the sales tax:
7.5% of $33.49 = 33.49 x 7.5/100 = $2.51

5. Add the tax to the discounted total:
$33.49 + $2.51 = $36.00

So, **$36** is the final amount of money Sandy spent on clothes.","First, let's calculate the total amount Sandy spent on clothes before any discounts or taxes:

Total amount spent on clothes = $13.99 (shorts) + $12.14 (shirt) + $7.43 (jacket) + $8.50 (shoes) + $10.75 (accessories)
Total amount spent on clothes = $52.81

Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the total amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $52.81
Discount amount = 0.10 * $52.81
Discount amount = $5.28

Now, let's subtract the discount amount from the total amount:

Total amount after discount = $52.81 - $5.28
Total amount after discount = $47.53

Next, let's add the $5.00 coupon to the total amount after discount:

Total amount after discount and coupon = $47.53 + $5.00
Total amount after discount and coupon = $52.53

Finally, let's calculate the 7.5% sales tax on the total amount after discount and coupon:

Sales tax amount = 7.5% of $52.53
Sales tax amount = 0.075 * $52.53
Sales tax amount = $3.964875

Since we can't have a fraction of a cent for the tax, we'll round it to the nearest cent:

Sales tax amount = $3.96

Now, let's add the sales tax amount to the total amount after discount and coupon:

Total amount after discount, coupon, and tax = $52.53 + $3.96
Total amount after discount, coupon, and tax = $56.49

Therefore, Sandy spent $56.49 on clothes after applying the discounts, coupon, and adding the tax.",Thirty-six,Fifty-six dollars and forty-nine cents,forty-five dollars and seventy-two cents

80% of 212 can be calculated as follows:
80/100 * 212 = 0.8 * 212 = 169.6

Since Lucy cannot have a fraction of a fish, we'll round the number to the nearest whole number. In this case, it would be 170 fish.

So, Lucy needs to buy 170 more fish to increase her collection by 80% of its current amount.","Lucy has 212 fish and wants 80% more, which is 212 * 0.8 = 169.6 fish. Her goal is to reach 212 + 169.6 = 381.6 fish.

Lucy needs 381.6 - 212 = **169.6** fish.","Lucy wants to increase her collection by 80% of its current amount. To find out how many more fish she needs to buy, we first need to calculate 80% of her current amount.

80% of 212 fish is:

Now, we add this amount to her current collection to find out how many fish she will have in total:
212 (current amount) + 170 (80% increase) = 382 fish

Lucy wants to have 382 fish in total, but she currently has 212 fish. To find out how many more fish she needs to buy, we subtract her current amount from her goal:

244,"Sam went to 14 football games this year and 29 games last year. The cost of attending a game varied throughout the two years. The attending price for a game this year was $45, while the attending price for the games he attended last year ranged from $40 to $65. If Sam paid the lowest price for one-third of last year's games and the highest price for one-fourth of last year's games, what was the total cost Sam spent on attending football games over the two years?","First, let's calculate the total cost for this year's games:

This year, Sam went to 14 games at $45 each, so the total cost for this year is:
14 games * $45/game = $630

Now, let's calculate the total cost for last year's games:

Last year, Sam went to 29 games. We know that he paid the lowest price ($40) for one-third of the games and the highest price ($65) for one-fourth of the games.

One-third of last year's games:
29 games / 3 ≈ 9.67, but since he can't attend a fraction of a game, we'll round down to 9 games at the lowest price.

One-fourth of last year's games:
29 games / 4 = 7.25, but again, he can't attend a fraction of a game, so we'll round down to 7 games at the highest price.

The remaining games would be at an unspecified price between $40 and $65, but since we don't have that information, we'll just calculate the cost for the games at the lowest and highest prices.

Lowest price games cost:
9 games * $40/game = $360

Highest price games cost:
7 games * $65/game = $455

Now, we need to find out how many games are left that we haven't calculated the cost for. We initially had 29 games, and we've accounted for 9 + 7 = 16 games. So, there are 29 - 16 = 13 games left. We don't know the exact price for these games, but we don't need to because we're only asked for the cost of the games at the lowest and highest prices.

Adding the costs for last year's games:
$360 (lowest price games) + $455 (highest price games) = $815

Now, let's add the total cost for both years:
$630 (this year) + $815 (last year) = $1445

So, the total cost Sam spent on attending football games over the two years is $1445.","Sam's total spending on football games across the two years equals $1185.

---

$1185","First, let's find out how many games Sam paid the lowest price for last year. Since he paid the lowest price for one-third of last year's games, we divide the total number of games he attended last year by 3:

29 / 3 = 9.666666666666667

Since we can't have a fraction of a game, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 9. This means Sam paid the lowest price for 9 of last year's games.

Now, let's find out how many games Sam paid the highest price for last year. Since he paid the highest price for one-fourth of last year's games, we divide the total number of games he attended last year by 4:

29 / 4 = 7.25

Again, we can't have a fraction of a game, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 7. This means Sam paid the highest price for 7 of last year's games.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for last year's games:

Lowest price for 9 games = $40 * 9 = $360
Highest price for 7 games = $65 * 7 = $455

Total cost for last year's games = $360 + $455 = $815

Next, let's calculate the total cost for this year's games:

Cost for 14 games = $45 * 14 = $630

Finally, let's add the total cost for both years to find the overall total:

How much money in total did Sara spend on movies after applying the discount voucher, and including the taxes?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the movie tickets before the discount:

Cost of movie tickets = $10.62 * 3 = $31.86

Now, let's apply the 20% discount voucher to the movie tickets:

Discount on movie tickets = 20% of $31.86 = 0.20 * $31.86 = $6.372

So, the discounted cost of the movie tickets is:

Discounted movie tickets = $31.86 - $6.372 = $25.488

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the movie rentals before tax:

Cost of movie rentals = $1.59 * 2 = $3.18

Now, let's calculate the 8% tax on the movie rentals:

Tax on movie rentals = 8% of $3.18 = 0.08 * $3.18 = $0.2544

So, the total cost of the movie rentals including tax is:

Total movie rentals = $3.18 + $0.2544 = $3.4344

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the movie purchases before tax:

Cost of movie purchases = $13.95 * 3 = $41.85

Now, let's calculate the 10% tax on the movie purchases:

Tax on movie purchases = 10% of $41.85 = 0.10 * $41.85 = $4.185

So, the total cost of the movie purchases including tax is:

Total movie purchases = $41.85 + $4.185 = $46.035

Finally, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount Sara spent:

Total spent = Discounted movie tickets + Total movie rentals + Total movie purchases

Cost of 3 tickets = $10.62/ticket * 3 tickets = $31.86

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the tickets:

Discount on tickets = 20% of $31.86 = 0.20 * $31.86 = $6.372

So, the total cost of the tickets after the discount is:

Total cost of tickets after discount = $31.86 - $6.372 = $25.488

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the movie rentals and purchases before taxes:

Cost of 2 rentals = $1.59/rental * 2 rentals = $3.18

Cost of 3 purchases = $13.95/purchase * 3 purchases = $41.85

Total cost of rentals and purchases before taxes = $3.18 + $41.85 = $45.03

Now, let's calculate the taxes on the rentals and purchases:

Tax on rentals = 8% of $3.18 = 0.08 * $3.18 = $0.2544

Tax on purchases = 10% of $41.85 = 0.10 * $41.85 = $4.185

Total taxes = $0.2544 + $4.185 = $4.4394

Now, let's add the total cost of the tickets after the discount, the total cost of the rentals and purchases before taxes, and the taxes to get the total amount Sara spent:

Total amount spent = $25.488 (tickets) + $45.03 (rentals and purchases) + $4.4394 (taxes) = $75.9574

How many oak trees of each species will the park have after 3 years, considering their respective growth rates?","Let's calculate the number of oak trees of each species after the changes mentioned:

For Quercus robur oak trees:
- Initially, there are 9 trees.
- 2 trees were cut down, so 9 - 2 = 7 trees remain.
- 4 new trees are planted, but they grow at a rate of 2 trees per year. After 3 years, 2 * 3 = 6 trees will have grown.
- So, the total number of Quercus robur oak trees after 3 years will be 7 (remaining) + 6 (grown) = 13 trees.

For Quercus alba oak trees:
- Initially, there are 11 trees.
- 3 trees were cut down, so 11 - 3 = 8 trees remain.
- 5 new trees are planted, but they grow at a rate of 1 tree per year. After 3 years, 1 * 3 = 3 trees will have grown.
- So, the total number of Quercus alba oak trees after 3 years will be 8 (remaining) + 3 (grown) = 11 trees.

After 3 years, we lose 2 damaged QR trees and gain 2 new QR trees in their place, resulting in a net increase of 0 QR trees. We also lose 3 damaged QA trees and gain 5 new ones, ending with 13 QA trees.

The park will have a total of 13 oak trees after 3 years.

Thirteen.","After cutting down the damaged trees, the park will have:

- 9 - 2 = 7 Quercus robur oak trees left.

- 4 new Quercus robur oak trees * 2 trees per year = 8 new Quercus robur oak trees.
- 5 new Quercus alba oak trees * 1 tree per year = 5 new Quercus alba oak trees.

So, after 3 years, the park will have:

- 7 Quercus robur oak trees left + 8 new Quercus robur oak trees = 15 Quercus robur oak trees.

How many limes did each person receive?","Let's denote the number of limes Alex received as A, the number of limes Tim received as T, and the number of limes Sara received as S.

According to the problem, Sara received twice as many limes as Alex, so we can write:
S = 2A

Alex received one lime less than Tim, so we can write:
A = T - 1

The total number of limes Dan picked is 9, so we can write:
A + T + S = 9

Now we can substitute S with 2A in the total equation:
A + T + 2A = 9
3A + T = 9

We also know that A = T - 1, so we can substitute A in the equation above:
3(T - 1) + T = 9
3T - 3 + T = 9
4T - 3 = 9
4T = 9 + 3
4T = 12
T = 12 / 4
T = 3

Now we know Tim received 3 limes. We can find out how many limes Alex received:
A = T - 1
A = 3 - 1
A = 2

And finally, we can find out how many limes Sara received:
S = 2A
S = 2 * 2
S = 4

So, Sara received 4 limes, Alex received 2 limes, and Tim received 3 limes.","Let's analyze this situation:
1. We know Dan has 9 limes.
2. Sara receives twice as many limes as Alex, which means Sara has 2 × Alex's limes.
3. Alex has one lime less than Tim, so Tim has Alex's limes + 1.

We can represent the number of limes as:
Tim = x
Alex = x - 1
Sara = 2(x - 1)

Substitute the numbers:
9 limes = Tim + Alex + Sara
9 = x + (x - 1) + 2(x - 1)
9 = 3x - 2

Add 2 to both sides:
x = 4

Tim has x = 4, Alex has x - 1 = 3, and Sara has 2(x - 1) = 6.
So, each person receives 4 limes.

**4**","Let's denote the number of limes Alex received as A. According to the information given, Alex received one lime less than Tim, so Tim received A + 1 limes.

Sara received twice as many limes as Alex, so Sara received 2A limes.

We know that in total, Dan picked 9 limes. So we can set up the following equation:

A + (A + 1) + 2A = 9

Combining like terms, we get:

4A + 2 = 9

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with A:

4A = 7

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for A:

A = 7 / 4

A = 1.75

Since Alex can't receive a fraction of a lime, we need to adjust the number of limes Alex received. We'll assume that Alex received one lime less than Tim, so Alex received A = 1.

Now we can find out how many limes Sara received:

Sara received 2A = 2 * 1 = 2 limes.

Finally, we can find out how many limes Tim received:

Tim received A + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 limes.

So, Alex received 1 lime, Sara received 2 limes, and Tim received 2 limes.",4,2,4
250,"Kyoko wants to buy 3 balls, 2 skipping ropes, and 4 frisbees. If each ball costs $1.54, each skipping rope $3.78, and each frisbee $2.63, and the store is offering a 7% discount on the total purchase, how much should Kyoko pay at checkout?","First, let's calculate the total cost of each item without the discount:

- For the balls: 3 balls * $1.54 per ball = $4.62
- For the skipping ropes: 2 skipping ropes * $3.78 per rope = $7.56
- For the frisbees: 4 frisbees * $2.63 per frisbee = $10.52

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $4.62 + $7.56 + $10.52 = $22.70

Now, let's calculate the discount amount:

Discount amount = 7% of $22.70 = 0.07 * $22.70 = $1.589

Since we usually don't deal with fractions of a cent when it comes to money, we'll round the discount to the nearest cent, which is $1.59.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to find the final amount Kyoko should pay:

Final amount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
Final amount = $22.70 - $1.59 = $21.11

Kyoko should pay $21.11 at checkout.","Kyoko's purchase includes:
- 3 balls at $1.54 each = $4.62
- 2 skipping ropes at $3.78 each = $7.56
- 4 frisbees at $2.63 each = $10.52

The total cost is $22.68. With a 7% discount, Kyoko's new total cost is $21.20.

Now, let's add up the total cost:

Total cost before discount = $4.62 (balls) + $7.56 (skipping ropes) + $10.52 (frisbees) = $22.70

Next, we calculate the discount:

Discount = 7% of $22.70 = 0.07 * $22.70 = $1.60

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Kyoko should pay:

Amount to pay = Total cost before discount - Discount = $22.70 - $1.60 = $21.10

So, Kyoko should pay $21.10 at checkout.",21.20,21.10,Twenty one dollars and eleven cents.

Each jump rope has a discount of $2, and each ball has a $1 discount. He has saved $30 from his allowance, his uncle gave him $25, and his grandma gave him an additional $10. Sales tax in his location is 8%. How much more money does Dalton need to buy the items including the discounts and tax?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discounts:

- Jump ropes: 3 jump ropes * $7 each = $21
- Board games: 2 board games * $12 each = $24
- Playground balls: 4 balls * $4 each = $16

Total cost before discounts = $21 + $24 + $16 = $61

Now, let's apply the discounts:

- Jump rope discount: 3 jump ropes * $2 discount each = $6 discount
- Playground ball discount: 4 balls * $1 discount each = $4 discount

Total discounts = $6 + $4 = $10

Subtract the total discounts from the total cost before discounts to get the total cost after discounts:

Total cost after discounts = $61 - $10 = $51

Now, let's calculate the sales tax:

Sales tax = Total cost after discounts * Sales tax rate
Sales tax = $51 * 8% = $51 * 0.08 = $4.08

Add the sales tax to the total cost after discounts to get the final total cost:

Final total cost = Total cost after discounts + Sales tax
Final total cost = $51 + $4.08 = $55.08

Finally, let's calculate how much money Dalton has:

Total money Dalton has = Money from allowance + Money from uncle + Money from grandma
Total money Dalton has = $30 + $25 + $10 = $65

Now, let's see if Dalton has enough money or if he needs more:

If Dalton's total money is greater than or equal to the final total cost, he has enough. If not, he needs more.

$65 (Dalton's total money) - $55.08 (Final total cost) = $9.92

Dalton has $9.92 more than he needs, so he does not need any additional money to buy the items including the discounts and tax.","Dalton needs to buy: 3 jump ropes at $7 each, 2 board games at $12 each, and 4 playground balls at $4 each.

The total cost is $15 + $24 + $12 = $51. 

With an 8% sales tax:

After the discounts and with the tax, Dalton needs $51 + $4.08 = $55.08 more. 

The final result is: Fifty Five Dollars and Eight Cents.","First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before any discounts or tax:

Total cost before discounts: $21 + $24 + $16 = $61

Now, let's calculate the discounts:

Jump rope discount: 3 jump ropes * $2 each = $6
Playground ball discount: 4 playground balls * $1 each = $4

Total discount: $6 + $4 = $10

Now, let's subtract the discounts from the total cost:

Total cost after discounts: $61 - $10 = $51

Next, we need to calculate the sales tax:

Sales tax: $51 * 8% = $4.08

Now, let's add the sales tax to the total cost after discounts:

Total cost including tax: $51 + $4.08 = $55.08

Finally, let's calculate how much more money Dalton needs to buy the items including the discounts and tax:

73 bales * 45 pounds/bale = 3285 pounds

Now, let's find out how many new bales Jason added:

96 bales (total now) - 73 bales (original) = 23 bales (added by Jason)

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the new bales Jason added, each weighing 50 pounds:

23 bales * 50 pounds/bale = 1150 pounds

Finally, let's add the weight of the original bales to the weight of the new bales to get the total weight of all the hay bales in the barn now:

3285 pounds (original bales) + 1150 pounds (new bales) = 4435 pounds

So, the total weight of the hay bales in the barn now is 4435 pounds.","We start with 73 hay bales, each weighing 45 pounds, giving us a total weight of 3,285 pounds.

Jason adds 96 new bales, each weighing 50 pounds, to the barn. We multiply the weight of one new bale by the total number of new bales: 50 pounds x 96 = 4,800 pounds.

Adding the two together gives us a final total weight of 8,085 pounds. 

**8085**","Before Jason stacked more bales in the barn, there were 73 bales of hay, each weighing 45 pounds. So the total weight of the hay bales before Jason added more was:

If Alyssa exchanges the maximum number of coins for higher denomination bills or coins without any coins left over, what coins and/or bills will she have, and what is the total value of her money?","Let's first calculate the total value of the coins Alyssa has:

- Quarters: 12 quarters × $0.25/quarter = $3.00
- Pennies: 7 pennies × $0.01/penny = $0.07
- Nickels: 20 nickels × $0.05/nickel = $1.00
- Dimes: 15 dimes × $0.10/dime = $1.50

Now, let's add up the total value of all the coins:
Total value = $3.00 (quarters) + $0.07 (pennies) + $1.00 (nickels) + $1.50 (dimes) = $5.57

Alyssa wants to minimize the total number of coins she has by exchanging them for higher denomination bills or coins. Let's start by converting the coins to the highest denomination possible without any coins left over.

Since Alyssa has more than $5.00, she can exchange for a $5 bill:

- 2 quarters (50 cents) leaving her with 7 cents.
- 1 nickel (5 cents) leaving her with 2 cents.
- 2 pennies (2 cents) leaving her with no cents.

260,"Tom found x seashells on the beach, where x is an integer greater than 5. He gave Jessica 2.5 seashells, and then he gave Mike one-third of his remaining seashells. How many seashells does Tom have now?","Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Tom found x seashells, where x is an integer greater than 5.
2. He gave Jessica 2.5 seashells. Since Tom can't give half a seashell (assuming seashells can't be divided), this is a bit of a tricky point. However, for the sake of the problem, let's assume that it's possible to give half a seashell. So after giving Jessica 2.5 seashells, Tom has x - 2.5 seashells left.
3. He then gave Mike one-third of his remaining seashells. So Mike receives (1/3) * (x - 2.5) seashells.

Now, let's calculate how many seashells Tom has after giving some to Mike:

Tom's remaining seashells after giving to Jessica = x - 2.5
Seashells given to Mike = (1/3) * (x - 2.5)

Tom's remaining seashells after giving to Mike = (x - 2.5) - (1/3) * (x - 2.5)
= (x - 2.5) - (x/3) + (2.5/3)
= (3x/3) - (2.5) - (x/3) + (2.5/3)
= (2x/3) - (2.5) + (2.5/3)
= (2x/3) - (2.5 - 2.5/3)
= (2x/3) - (7.5/3)
= (2x/3) - (7.5/3)

Now, we simplify the expression:

= (2x - 7.5)/3

So, Tom has (2x - 7.5)/3 seashells left after giving some to Mike. Since x is an integer greater than 5, the result will be a specific number depending on the value of x. However, without the exact value of x, we cannot determine the exact number of seashells Tom has left.","Tom started with a number of seashells greater than 5. He gave Jessica 2.5, meaning he has 3.5 left. Then, he gave away one-third of his remaining seashells, which equates to 1.1666 repeating. This means Tom has 2.3333 repeating seashells left, which can be rounded to **2** for simplicity.","Let's denote the number of seashells Tom has now as T.

Tom started with x seashells, and he gave Jessica 2.5 seashells. So, the number of seashells he had left after giving Jessica some is:
x - 2.5

Then, he gave Mike one-third of his remaining seashells. So, the number of seashells he gave to Mike is:
(1/3) * (x - 2.5)

Now, let's calculate the number of seashells Tom has left after giving some to Mike:
T = x - 2.5 - (1/3) * (x - 2.5)

To simplify the expression, we can multiply the entire equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3T = 3x - 7.5 - (x - 2.5)

Now, let's combine like terms:
3T = 3x - 7.5 + x - 2.5
3T = 4x - 10

Now, we can solve for T:
T = (4x - 10) / 3

Since x is an integer greater than 5, we can choose x = 6 to make the math simpler. Now, we have:
T = (4 * 6 - 10) / 3
T = (24 - 10) / 3
T = 14 / 3
T = 4.67 (approximately)

So, Tom has approximately 4.67 seashells left.",2,4.67,2x/3
261,"Chris has been saving his allowance to buy a new pair of soccer cleats and a ball. He receives birthday money from multiple relatives in different currencies. His grandmother gave Chris USD 25. His aunt and uncle gave him EUR 20 (1 USD = 0.85 EUR). His parents gave him CAD 75 (1 USD = 1.25 CAD), and a family friend gave him GBP 30 (1 USD = 0.72 GBP).

After converting all amounts to USD and adding them to his previous savings, Chris has USD 279. How much money did Chris have before his birthday, in USD?","First, let's convert all the foreign currencies to USD.

From his aunt and uncle, Chris received EUR 20. To convert this to USD:
EUR 20 * (1 USD / 0.85 EUR) = USD 23.53 (rounded to two decimal places)

From his parents, Chris received CAD 75. To convert this to USD:
CAD 75 * (1 USD / 1.25 CAD) = USD 60

From the family friend, Chris received GBP 30. To convert this to USD:
GBP 30 * (1 USD / 0.72 GBP) = USD 41.67 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, let's add all the amounts in USD:
Grandmother's gift: USD 25
Aunt and Uncle's gift: USD 23.53
Parents' gift: USD 60
Family friend's gift: USD 41.67

Total birthday money in USD: 25 + 23.53 + 60 + 41.67 = USD 150.20

Chris has a total of USD 279 after adding his birthday money. To find out how much he had before his birthday, we subtract the birthday money from the total:

USD 279 - USD 150.20 = USD 128.80

Chris had USD 128.80 before his birthday.","Let's solve this together!

Chris received the following amounts of money:

- USD 25 from his grandmother
- EUR 20 from his aunt and uncle. This needs to be converted to USD, which gives 17.25 USD (0.85 x 20)
- CAD 75 from his parents. This equates to 93.75 USD (1.25 x 75)
- GBP 30 from a family friend. This amount translates to 21.60 USD (0.72 x 30)

Adding these converted amounts to the money Chris already had, we can conclude that Chris had a total of USD 137 before his birthday. 

The final answer is 137.","First, let's convert all the currencies to USD:

- EUR 20 to USD: 20 * 0.85 = USD 17
- CAD 75 to USD: 75 * 1.25 = USD 93.75
- GBP 30 to USD: 30 * 0.72 = USD 21.60

Now, let's add up all the USD amounts:

- USD 25 (from grandmother)
- USD 17 (from aunt and uncle)
- USD 93.75 (from parents)
- USD 21.60 (from family friend)

Total USD = USD 25 + USD 17 + USD 93.75 + USD 21.60 = USD 157.35

Now, let's add this to the USD 279 Chris has after converting all the currencies:

Total USD = USD 157.35 + USD 279 = USD 436.35

To find out how much money Chris had before his birthday, we subtract the amount he had before from the total amount he had after:

Amount before birthday = Total USD - Amount after birthday
Amount before birthday = USD 436.35 - USD 279 = USD 157.35

If she then deposits $5000 into the account, how much money was in the account before the initial transfer?","Let's denote the original amount of money in Christina's account as X.

After transferring 20% of her money out of the account, she is left with 80% of X in the account. According to the information provided, this amount is $30,000.

So, we can write the equation as:
80% of X = $30,000

To find X, we can convert the percentage to a decimal and solve for X:
0.80 * X = $30,000

Now, divide both sides by 0.80 to isolate X:
X = $30,000 / 0.80
X = $37,500

Therefore, the original amount of money in the account before the initial transfer was $37,500.

If she then deposits $5,000 into the account, the new balance would be:
$30,000 + $5,000 = $35,000

But since we are asked for the amount before the initial transfer, the answer is $37,500.","Christina had $45,000 in her account before the transfer. 

$30,000 is 20% * x, so x = $30,000 / 0.2 = $150,000. Then $150,000 - 20% = $120,000 which is the amount of money Christina had before depositing the $5,000.
 
$120,000.","Let's denote the initial amount of money in Christina's account as \( x \).

After transferring 20% of her money out of the account, the account is left with 80% of the initial amount. We can express this as:

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\( x = \frac{$30,000}{0.80} \)

W_Charles = 2,483 - 463 = 2,020 whistles

Now that we know W_Charles, we can find W_Alex by subtracting another 131 whistles:
W_Alex = 2,020 - 131 = 1,889 whistles

The combined total of whistles is simply the sum of W_Charles and W_Alex plus the known number of whistles W_Sean has:

264,"Paul sold 60% of his books in a garage sale, which left him with 27 books. How many books did he initially have?","If Paul sold 60% of his books, that means he has 40% of his books left. The 27 books he has left represent this 40%. To find out the initial number of books, we can set up a proportion where 40% is to 27 books as 100% is to the initial number of books (which we'll call X).

So, 40% / 100% = 27 books / X books

To solve for X, we can cross-multiply and divide:

(40/100) * X = 27
X = 27 / (40/100)
X = 27 / 0.4
X = 67.5

B = 5,467 - 1,932
B = 3,535

Now, to find the total number of pupils in the school, we add the number of girls G and the number of boys B:

Total pupils = G + B

Total pupils = 5,467 + 3,535
Total pupils = 9,002

So, there are 9,002 pupils in the school.","We are asked to find the total number of pupils in the school, which we can determine by solving for B in terms of G and D. Here are the steps to solve:

1. Start with the given information: G = 5,467 and D = 1,932.

2. We are told that D represents the difference between G and B, so we can write the equation: 

G - B = D

3. Substitute the known values into the equation: 

5,467 - B = 1,932

4. To solve for B, we add B to both sides of the equation: 

B = 5,467 - 1,932

5. This gives us B = 3,535.

6. Now, we add G and B to get the total number of pupils: 

G + B = 5,467 + 3,535 = 9,002 pupils.

For bananas:
There are 192 bananas and they are organized into 345 groups.
192 bananas ÷ 345 groups = 0.5565 bananas per group

How much money did they make from selling all these items?","To calculate the total money made from selling all these items, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by the profit made from each item and then sum up all the profits.

For t-shirts:
183 t-shirts * $62 per t-shirt = $11,346

For jerseys:
31 jerseys * $99 per jersey = $3,069

For hats:
142 hats * $45 per hat = $6,390

How many books are there on each of the three bookshelves?,"Let's denote the number of books on the third bookshelf as x. According to the information given, the second bookshelf has twice as many books as the third, so it has 2x books.

We know the total number of books across all three bookshelves is 34, and we already know the first bookshelf has 10 books. So we can write the following equation to represent the total:

10 (first bookshelf) + 2x (second bookshelf) + x (third bookshelf) = 34

Combining like terms, we get:

10 + 3x = 34

Now, we'll solve for x:

3x = 34 - 10
3x = 24

Now he has 21 bottle caps, 52 wrappers, and 15 colorful stones in his collection. How many more items in total (bottle caps, wrappers, and stones) did Danny find at the park than he already had in his collection before going to the park?","To find out how many more items Danny found at the park than he already had in his collection, we need to compare the number of items he found at the park with the number of items he had in his collection before going to the park.

Let's start with the bottle caps:
He found 50 bottle caps at the park and already had 21 in his collection.
50 (found at the park) - 21 (already had) = 29 more bottle caps found at the park.

Now, let's look at the wrappers:
He found 46 wrappers at the park and already had 52 in his collection.
46 (found at the park) - 52 (already had) = -6, which means he actually had 6 more wrappers in his collection than he found at the park.

Finally, let's consider the colorful stones:
He found 27 colorful stones at the park and already had 15 in his collection.
27 (found at the park) - 15 (already had) = 12 more colorful stones found at the park.

Now, let's add up the additional items he found at the park (only counting the items he found more of at the park):
29 (bottle caps) + 0 (wrappers, since he had more in his collection) + 12 (colorful stones) = 41 more items found at the park than he already had in his collection. 

Note: We do not include the wrappers in the total since he did not find more wrappers at the park than he already had in his collection.","Danny had 21 bottle caps, 52 wrappers, and 15 stones before going to the park.

Sixty-five.","Danny found 46 wrappers, 50 bottle caps, and 27 colorful stones at the park. After going to the park, he had 21 bottle caps, 52 wrappers, and 15 colorful stones in his collection.

To find out how many more items he found at the park than he already had in his collection, we need to compare the number of items he found at the park with the number of items he had in his collection before going to the park.

First, let's calculate the number of items he had in his collection before going to the park:
- 21 bottle caps
- 52 wrappers
- 15 colorful stones

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total number of items in his collection before going to the park:

How many apps did he have on his phone at the start?","Let's denote the number of apps Dave had at the start as ""A"". After deleting 18 apps, he had A - 18 apps left. Then he installed ""x"" number of new apps, so he had (A - 18) + x apps. According to the information given, after these transactions, he had 5 apps left.

So we can set up the equation:

(A - 18) + x = 5

To find the number of apps Dave had at the start, we need to solve for A:

A - 18 + x = 5
A = 5 + 18 - x
A = 23 - x

So, Dave had (23 - x) apps on his phone at the start.","Dave had 28 apps on his phone initially.
 
Dave started with a total of 28 apps, deleted 18, then installed x amount, resulting in 5 left. The equation would be expressed as:

Solving for the total, we get x = 13, and adding this to the deleted apps, we find the initial number to be 28. 

Twenty-eight.","Let's denote the number of apps Dave had on his phone at the start as ""A"".

According to the information given, after deleting 18 apps, he installed ""x"" number of new apps, and then had 5 apps left. This means that the total number of apps he had after installing the new ones is A - 18 + x.

We know that after installing the new apps, he had 5 apps left, so we can write the equation:

A - 18 + x = 5

Now, let's solve for A:

A - 18 + x = 5
A - 18 = 5 - x
A = 5 - x + 18
A = 23 - x

Since we don't know the value of ""x"", we cannot determine the exact number of apps Dave had at the start. However, we can say that the number of apps he had at the start was at least 23, because if he had 23 apps and deleted 18, he would have 5 apps left, which matches the information given.

273,"Dan has $200. He decides to buy 25 candy bars, 10 bags of chips, and 15 soft drinks. Each candy bar costs $3, each bag of chips costs $2.50, and each soft drink costs $1.75. There is a discount of 10% on candy bars and 5% on bags of chips. Additionally, there is a 6% sales tax applied to the total cost before discounts. How much money is left after his purchase?","First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before discounts and taxes:

Candy bars: 25 candy bars * $3 each = $75
Bags of chips: 10 bags * $2.50 each = $25
Soft drinks: 15 soft drinks * $1.75 each = $26.25

Now, let's calculate the total cost before discounts and taxes:

Total cost before discounts and taxes = $75 + $25 + $26.25 = $126.25

Next, we'll calculate the discounts for the candy bars and bags of chips:

Discount on candy bars: 10% of $75 = 0.10 * $75 = $7.50
Discount on bags of chips: 5% of $25 = 0.05 * $25 = $1.25

Now, let's subtract the discounts from the total cost before taxes:

Total cost after discounts = $126.25 - $7.50 - $1.25 = $117.50

Now, we'll calculate the sales tax:

Sales tax: 6% of $117.50 = 0.06 * $117.50 = $7.05

Now, let's add the sales tax to the total cost after discounts to get the final total cost:

Final total cost = $117.50 + $7.05 = $124.55

Finally, let's subtract the final total cost from Dan's initial amount to find out how much money he has left:

Money left = $200 - $124.55 = $75.45

Dan has $75.45 left after his purchase.","Dan initially has $200. Candy bars cost $3 each, so the 25 candy bars amount to $75. Bags of chips cost $2.50 each, summing up to $25 for 10 bags. Soft drinks cost $1.75 each, resulting in a cost of $26.25 for 15 drinks. The total cost before discounts is $126.25. 

With a 10% discount, the candy bars now cost $20 off, totaling at $55. The 5% discount on the bags of chips equates to a discount of $1.25 per bag, so the 10 bags cost $23.75 now. There is no discount on the soft drinks, so their cost remains at $26.25. 

The total cost after discounts is $105.00. With a 6% sales tax, the final cost amounts to $110.70. 

Dan has $89.30 left.

Money: $89.30","First, let's calculate the total cost before discounts and tax:

Cost of candy bars = 25 candy bars * $3 each = $75
Cost of bags of chips = 10 bags * $2.50 each = $25
Cost of soft drinks = 15 soft drinks * $1.75 each = $26.25

Total cost before discounts and tax = $75 (candy bars) + $25 (bags of chips) + $26.25 (soft drinks) = $126.25

Now, let's apply the discounts:

Discount on candy bars = 10% of $75 = 0.10 * $75 = $7.50
Discount on bags of chips = 5% of $25 = 0.05 * $25 = $1.25

Total discount = $7.50 (candy bars) + $1.25 (bags of chips) = $8.75

Now, let's subtract the discounts from the total cost before discounts and tax:

Total cost after discounts = $126.25 (before discounts) - $8.75 (discounts) = $117.50

Next, we apply the 6% sales tax to the total cost after discounts:

Jackie has 125 apples, and Adam has 98 apples. 

125 (Jackie's apples) + 98 (Adam's apples) = 223 apples combined.

Now, we compare this to the number of apples Laura has, which is 173 apples.

1 meter is equal to 39.37 inches.

The frog jumped 0.95 meters, so in inches that would be:
0.95 meters * 39.37 inches/meter = 37.4015 inches

Now we can add the grasshopper's jump to the frog's jump:
31 inches (grasshopper) + 37.4015 inches (frog) = 68.4015 inches

Now we need to convert the total inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

68.4015 inches / 12 inches/foot = 5.700125 feet

So, together they jumped a total of approximately 5.700125 feet.","To solve this, we need to convert the given distances into feet, which can be done in the following steps:

1. 31 inches is directly given in inches, so no conversion is needed.

2. 0.95 meters must be converted into feet. There are 3.28 feet in 1 meter, so 0.95 meters is equal to 3.11 feet. 

Adding these two distances gives us a total of 42.31 inches or 3.53 feet. 

Therefore, the final result is 3.53. 

Peace.","First, we need to convert the frog's jump from meters to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot and 1 meter is equal to 3.28 feet, we can calculate the frog's jump in inches by multiplying 0.95 meters by 3.28 feet per meter:

0.95 meters * 3.28 feet/meter = 3.136 inches

Now, we add the grasshopper's jump to the frog's jump to get the total jump in inches:

31 inches (grasshopper's jump) + 3.136 inches (frog's jump) = 34.136 inches

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 inches per foot:

How many pieces of gum does Lucy have left after giving away and donating the gum?","First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of gum Lucy has from the packages:

103 packages * 35 pieces per package = 3605 pieces of gum

Now, let's add the additional single pieces of gum she has:

3605 pieces + 17 single pieces = 3622 pieces of gum

Lucy gives away half of her gum packages to her friends. Since she has 103 packages, half would be:

103 packages / 2 = 51.5 packages

Since she can't give away half a package, we'll assume she gives away 51 packages and keeps the remaining 52 packages for herself. The number of pieces of gum in 51 packages is:

51 packages * 35 pieces per package = 1785 pieces of gum

Now, let's calculate how much gum she donates to the charity event. She donates 3 times the amount she gave away to her friends:

1785 pieces * 3 = 5355 pieces of gum

Now, let's calculate how much gum Lucy has left after giving away to her friends and donating to the charity event. We'll subtract the pieces she gave away and the pieces she donated from her original total:

3622 pieces (original total) - 1785 pieces (given away) - 5355 pieces (donated) = -3518 pieces

This result doesn't make sense because Lucy can't have a negative number of pieces of gum. It seems we've made a mistake in our calculation. We should not subtract the pieces given away twice. The pieces donated to the charity are not from Lucy's remaining gum but are already accounted for in the pieces given away to her friends. So we should only subtract the pieces given away once.

Let's correct the calculation:

3622 pieces (original total) - 1785 pieces (given away) = 1837 pieces of gum

Now, Lucy has 1837 pieces of gum left after giving away to her friends. We don't need to subtract the donated pieces again because they were already included in the pieces given away.

3605 pieces + 17 pieces = 3622 pieces of gum

Lucy decides to give away half of her gum packages, so she gives away:

103 packages / 2 = 51.5 packages

Since she can't give away half a package, we'll assume she gives away 51 packages. This means she has:

103 packages - 51 packages = 52 packages left

Now, Lucy donates 3 times the amount of gum she has given away to a charity event. So, she donates:

3 * 51 packages = 153 packages

However, since she can't donate half a package, we'll assume she donates 152 packages. This means she has:

52 packages left - 152 packages donated = -100 packages

Lucy can't donate negative packages, so we need to adjust the number of packages she gives away. Let's assume she gives away 50 packages, which is the closest number that allows her to donate a whole number of packages. So, she has:

103 packages - 50 packages = 53 packages left

Now, Lucy donates 3 times the amount of gum she has given away to a charity event. So, she donates:

3 * 50 packages = 150 packages

Since she can't donate negative packages, we'll assume she donates 150 packages. This means she has:

If Ed had 45 marbles, how many more marbles did Ed have than the combined marbles of Doug and Frank after their losses?","Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Doug had initially. Since Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug and Ed had 45 marbles, Doug had 45 - 10 = 35 marbles.

Doug lost 11 of his marbles, so after the loss, Doug had 35 - 11 = 24 marbles.

Frank had 15 marbles more than Doug initially, so Frank had 35 + 15 = 50 marbles.

Frank lost 7 of his marbles, so after the loss, Frank had 50 - 7 = 43 marbles.

Now, let's find the combined number of marbles Doug and Frank had after their losses: 24 (Doug's marbles) + 43 (Frank's marbles) = 67 marbles.

Finally, we'll determine how many more marbles Ed had than the combined marbles of Doug and Frank after their losses: 45 (Ed's marbles) - 67 (combined marbles of Doug and Frank) = -22 marbles.

This means that Doug and Frank together had 22 more marbles than Ed after their losses. However, since the question asks for how many more marbles Ed had, it seems there might be a mistake in the initial information or the question, as the calculation shows that Ed did not have more marbles than Doug and Frank combined after their losses.","Let's solve this together!

First, we need to find out how many marbles Doug has. We know that Ed has 45, and Doug has 10 fewer: 45 - 10 = 35 marbles. 

Next, we'll figure out how many marbles Doug has left after his trip to the playground. 35 marbles - 11 marbles lost = 24 marbles. 

Now, let's calculate Frank's current marble count. Starting with 15 more than Doug, and losing 7 leaves us with: 24 + 15 = 39 marbles. 

Combining Doug's and Frank's post-loss marble counts, we get: 24 marbles + 39 marbles = 63 marbles. 

Comparing Ed's marbles to the combined total of Doug's and Frank's, we can conclude that Ed has 45 marbles - 63 marbles = 18 more marbles than them.

The final result is **EIGHTEEN**.","Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had initially as D. According to the information given, Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had D + 10 marbles.

Doug lost 11 of his marbles, so he had D - 11 marbles left.

Frank had 15 marbles more than Doug, so Frank had D + 15 marbles.

Frank lost 7 marbles, so he had D + 15 - 7 = D + 8 marbles left.

We know that Ed had 45 marbles, so we can set up the equation:

D + 10 = 45

Now, let's solve for D:

D = 45 - 10
D = 35

So, Doug initially had 35 marbles.

Now, let's find out how many marbles Doug and Frank have left after their losses:

Doug has D - 11 = 35 - 11 = 24 marbles left.

Frank has D + 8 = 35 + 8 = 43 marbles left.

Now, let's find out how many more marbles Ed has than the combined marbles of Doug and Frank after their losses:

Calculate the difference between the number of emails he received in the morning and the afternoon, and then find the percentage of the total emails received that this difference represents.","First, let's calculate the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the afternoon:

Difference = Emails in the afternoon - Emails in the morning
Difference = 8 emails - 6 emails
Difference = 2 emails

Now, let's calculate the total number of emails Jack received throughout the day:

Total emails = Emails in the morning + Emails in the afternoon + Emails in the evening
Total emails = 6 emails + 8 emails + 12 emails
Total emails = 26 emails

To find the percentage that the difference represents of the total emails, we use the following formula:

Percentage = (Difference / Total emails) * 100

Percentage = (2 emails / 26 emails) * 100
Percentage = (2 / 26) * 100
Percentage = 0.07692307692 * 100
Percentage ≈ 7.69%

So, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the afternoon represents approximately 7.69% of the total emails he received throughout the day.","Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 in the afternoon, so the difference between these two amounts is 8 - 6 = 2 emails.

In the evening, he got 12 emails, making the total number of emails received throughout the day 6 + 8 + 12 = 26.

The difference between the morning and afternoon emails accounts for 2 out of 26 emails, which is approximately 7.7% of the total.

7%.","First, let's calculate the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the afternoon:

283,"Lewis and Clark are working together during a 7-week harvest season. Lewis earns $250 per week, while Clark earns $350 per week. However, Lewis works 8 hours a day, while Clark works 10 hours a day. If there are 6 working days in a week, how much does each person earn per hour for the entire harvest season assuming they both work every day throughout the season?","First, let's calculate the total earnings for each person during the 7-week harvest season.

Lewis earns $250 per week. Over 7 weeks, his total earnings would be:
$250/week * 7 weeks = $1750

Clark earns $350 per week. Over 7 weeks, his total earnings would be:
$350/week * 7 weeks = $2450

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours each person works during the 7-week harvest season.

Lewis works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week. Over 7 weeks, his total number of hours worked would be:
8 hours/day * 6 days/week * 7 weeks = 336 hours

Clark works 10 hours a day for 6 days a week. Over 7 weeks, his total number of hours worked would be:
10 hours/day * 6 days/week * 7 weeks = 420 hours

Now, we can calculate the hourly wage for each person.

Lewis's hourly wage would be his total earnings divided by his total hours worked:
$1750 / 336 hours = $5.21 per hour (rounded to two decimal places)

Clark's hourly wage would be his total earnings divided by his total hours worked:
$2450 / 420 hours = $5.83 per hour (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, Lewis earns approximately $5.21 per hour, and Clark earns approximately $5.83 per hour for the entire harvest season.","Lewis' weekly earnings divide into hourly earnings of $250 / 8 hours = $31.25 per hour.
Clark's weekly earnings divide into hourly earnings of $350 / 10 hours = $35 per hour.
For the entire harvest season, Lewis will earn $31.25 x 6 days x 7 weeks = $1305.
Clark's total earnings will be $35 x 6 x 7 = $1470.

$1470.","First, let's calculate the total earnings for each person over the entire harvest season.

Lewis earns $250 per week, so over the 7-week harvest season, he earns:
$250/week * 7 weeks = $1750

Clark earns $350 per week, so over the 7-week harvest season, he earns:
$350/week * 7 weeks = $2450

Now, let's calculate the total hours each person works over the entire harvest season.

Lewis works 8 hours a day, so over the 6 working days in a week, he works:
8 hours/day * 6 days/week = 48 hours/week

Over the 7-week harvest season, Lewis works:
48 hours/week * 7 weeks = 336 hours

Clark works 10 hours a day, so over the 6 working days in a week, he works:

Red peaches: 7
Green peaches: 8

Combined red and green peaches = 7 + 8 = 15

According to the condition, the number of yellow peaches should be twice the combined number of red and green peaches. So we need to have:

2 * (combined red and green peaches) = 2 * 15 = 30 yellow peaches

Currently, there are 15 yellow peaches in the basket. To find out how many more yellow peaches we need to add to satisfy the condition, we subtract the current number of yellow peaches from the required number:

Required yellow peaches - Current yellow peaches = 30 - 15 = 15

- 12 sparrows
- 5 pigeons
- 9 crows
- 8 storks

Later, 15 more storks and 4 more pigeons joined them, so now there are:
- 12 sparrows (unchanged)
- 5 + 4 = 9 pigeons
- 9 crows (unchanged)
- 8 + 15 = 23 storks

Now, let's find the total number of birds (excluding storks):
- Sparrows + Pigeons + Crows = 12 + 9 + 9 = 30

Now, let's compare the number of storks to the total number of other birds:
- Storks = 23
- Other birds = 30

The difference in the number of storks compared to the total number of other birds is:
- 23 (storks) - 30 (other birds) = -7

Since the result is negative, it means there are 7 fewer storks than the combined number of sparrows, pigeons, and crows, not more.","There are 12 sparrows, 5 pigeons, 9 crows, and 8 storks on the fence initially. We can represent this as:
Sparrows = 12, Pigeons = 5, Crows = 9, Storks = 8.

286,"The grasshopper, the frog, the mouse, and the squirrel had a jumping contest with obstacles. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches, but it encountered an obstacle which reduced its jump distance by 3 inches.

The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, but encountered an obstacle that reduced its jump distance by 5 inches. The squirrel jumped 7 inches less than the mouse, and it faced a 2-inch obstacle. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper, considering the obstacles they encountered?","First, let's calculate the actual jump distance for each animal after considering the obstacles they encountered.

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches, but an obstacle reduced its jump by 3 inches. So, the grasshopper's actual jump distance is:
19 inches - 3 inches = 16 inches

The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper's initial jump (without considering the obstacle), so the frog's jump distance is:
19 inches + 10 inches = 29 inches
The frog did not encounter any obstacles, so its actual jump distance remains 29 inches.

The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so the mouse's initial jump distance is:
29 inches + 20 inches = 49 inches
However, the mouse encountered an obstacle that reduced its jump by 5 inches, so the mouse's actual jump distance is:
49 inches - 5 inches = 44 inches

The squirrel jumped 7 inches less than the mouse, so the squirrel's initial jump distance is:
44 inches - 7 inches = 37 inches
The squirrel faced a 2-inch obstacle, so its actual jump distance is:
37 inches - 2 inches = 35 inches

Now, to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, considering the obstacles they encountered, we subtract the grasshopper's actual jump distance from the mouse's actual jump distance:
44 inches (mouse) - 16 inches (grasshopper) = 28 inches

The mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper, considering the obstacles they encountered.","Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
2. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so 19 + 10 = 29 inches.
3. The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so 29 + 20 = 49 inches.
4. The mouse encountered a 5-inch obstacle, so its actual jump distance was 49 - 5 = 44 inches.
5. The squirrel jumped 7 inches less than the mouse, so 44 - 7 = 37 inches.
6. The squirrel encountered a 2-inch obstacle, so its actual jump distance was 37 - 2 = 35 inches.

Comparing the mouse's and grasshopper's jumps, the mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the grasshopper considering the obstacles they encountered.

**30**","Let's calculate the jumps of each animal step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches and then encountered an obstacle that reduced its jump distance by 3 inches. So, the grasshopper's jump after the obstacle is:
   19 inches - 3 inches = 16 inches

2. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper without encountering any obstacles. So, the frog's jump is:
   19 inches (grasshopper's jump) + 10 inches (difference) = 29 inches

3. The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, but it encountered an obstacle that reduced its jump distance by 5 inches. So, the mouse's jump after the obstacle is:
   29 inches (frog's jump) + 20 inches (difference) - 5 inches (obstacle) = 44 inches - 5 inches = 39 inches

4. The squirrel jumped 7 inches less than the mouse, and it faced a 2-inch obstacle. So, the squirrel's jump after the obstacle is:
   39 inches (mouse's jump) - 7 inches (difference) - 2 inches (obstacle) = 39 inches - 7 inches - 2 inches = 30 inches

Now, let's find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, considering the obstacles they encountered:

The mouse jumped 39 inches, and the grasshopper jumped 16 inches after the obstacle. So, the difference is:
39 inches (mouse's jump) - 16 inches (grasshopper's jump after obstacle) = 23 inches

Therefore, the mouse jumped 23 inches farther than the grasshopper, considering the obstacles they encountered.",30,23,28

Initially, Paul had 4.5 books. He then bought 175.3 new books, so the total number of books he would have after buying new ones would be:

4.5 (initial books) + 175.3 (new books) = 179.8 books

Now, we know that after selling some books, he has 62.8 books. So, the number of books he sold would be the difference between the number of books he would have after buying new ones and the number of books he has now:

179.8 (total after buying) - 62.8 (current books) = S (books sold)

Solving for S:

S = 179.8 - 62.8
S = 117

Paul sold 117 books.","Paul initially had 4.5 books and later has 62.8 books. The difference between these two numbers represents the number of books he sold in the garage sale. We then subtract:

According to the information given, Paul now has 62.8 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\( 4.5 - x + 175.3 = 62.8 \)

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, and Kevin has twice as many apples as Jackie. How many apples does He have?","Let's denote the number of apples Jackie has as J. According to the problem:

Kevin has twice as many apples as Jackie, so Kevin has 2J apples.
Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has J + 8 apples.

The total number of apples Adam, Jackie, and Kevin have combined is 20, so we can write the equation:

J (Jackie's apples) + 2J (Kevin's apples) + (J + 8) (Adam's apples) = 20

Combining like terms, we get:

J + 2J + J + 8 = 20
4J + 8 = 20

Subtract 8 from both sides to solve for J:

4J = 20 - 8
4J = 12

Divide both sides by 4 to find the number of apples Jackie has:

J = 12 / 4
J = 3

Now we know Jackie has 3 apples. Let's find out how many apples Adam and Kevin have:

Adam has J + 8 apples, so Adam has 3 + 8 = 11 apples.
Kevin has 2J apples, so Kevin has 2 * 3 = 6 apples.

Now let's check if the total adds up to 20:

Jackie's apples (3) + Adam's apples (11) + Kevin's apples (6) = 3 + 11 + 6 = 20

The total is indeed 20, so our calculations for Jackie, Adam, and Kevin are correct.

Now, according to the problem, ""He"" has 3 times as many apples as Adam, Jackie, and Kevin combined. Since they have 20 apples combined:

He has 3 * 20 = 60 apples.","Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. Start with setting up the known facts:
Adam has A apples
Jackie has J apples
Kevin has K apples
He has H apples
We also know that A + J + K = 20

2. We are told that H = 3 * (A + J + K), which we can substitute from step 1:
H = 3 * 20

3. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, which means A = J + 8

4. Kevin has twice as many apples as Jackie, so K = 2 * J

5. Now we can find the value of J by substituting the known values into the equation from step 1:
J + K + A = 20
J + 2J + J + 8 = 20
4J + 8 = 20
4J = 12
J = 3

6. Now we can substitute the value of J into the equations for A and K:
A = J + 8 = 3 + 8 = 11
K = 2 * J = 2 * 3 = 6

7. Now that we have the values of A, J, and K, we can find H using the equation from step 2:
H = 3 * (A + J + K)
H = 3 * (11 + 3 + 6) = 3 * 20 = 60

He has 60 apples.

Sixty.","Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A, the number of apples Jackie has as J, and the number of apples Kevin has as K.

According to the information given, we have the following equations:

1) A + J + K = 20 (the total number of apples)
2) A = J + 8 (Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie)
3) K = 2J (Kevin has twice as many apples as Jackie)

Now, let's substitute the value of K from equation 3 into equation 1:

A + J + 2J = 20
A + 3J = 20

Now, let's substitute the value of A from equation 2 into equation 1:

(J + 8) + J + 2J = 20
2J + 9J = 20
11J = 20
J = 20 / 11
J = 1.818181818 (since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we'll round to the nearest whole number)

Now, let's find the value of A using equation 2:

A = J + 8
A = 1.818181818 + 8
A = 9.818181818 (again, we'll round to the nearest whole number)

Now, let's find the value of K using equation 3:

K = 2J
K = 2 * 1.818181818
K = 3.636363636 (again, we'll round to the nearest whole number)

Now, let's check if the values we've found satisfy equation 1:

A + J + K = 20
9.818181818 + 1.818181818 + 3.636363636 = 20
15.272727272 = 20

Since the sum of the apples is not equal to 20, we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our calculations.

According to equation 2, A = J + 8. So, if A = 9.818181818, then J = A - 8 = 9.818181818 - 8 = 1.818181818 (again, we'll round to the nearest whole number).

- Navel: 125 sacks of ripe oranges and 65 sacks of unripe oranges
- Blood: 60 sacks of ripe oranges and 42 sacks of unripe oranges

However, during the weekends, the harvest rates change due to fewer workers:

- Valencia: 75 sacks of ripe oranges and 33 sacks of unripe oranges
- Navel: 100 sacks of ripe oranges and 57 sacks of unripe oranges
- Blood: 45 sacks of ripe oranges and 36 sacks of unripe oranges

Considering each type of orange and the varying harvest rates on weekdays and weekends, what is the total difference between sacks of ripe and unripe oranges harvested in a week, assuming the week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday?","To calculate the total difference between sacks of ripe and unripe oranges harvested in a week, we need to consider the harvest rates for both weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the total number of sacks of ripe and unripe oranges harvested for each type during the weekdays (Monday to Friday):

Valencia ripe: 90 sacks/day * 5 days = 450 sacks
Valencia unripe: 38 sacks/day * 5 days = 190 sacks

Navel ripe: 125 sacks/day * 5 days = 625 sacks
Navel unripe: 65 sacks/day * 5 days = 325 sacks

Blood ripe: 60 sacks/day * 5 days = 300 sacks
Blood unripe: 42 sacks/day * 5 days = 210 sacks

Now, let's calculate the total number of sacks of ripe and unripe oranges harvested for each type during the weekends (Saturday and Sunday):

Valencia ripe: 75 sacks/day * 2 days = 150 sacks
Valencia unripe: 33 sacks/day * 2 days = 66 sacks

Navel ripe: 100 sacks/day * 2 days = 200 sacks
Navel unripe: 57 sacks/day * 2 days = 114 sacks

Blood ripe: 45 sacks/day * 2 days = 90 sacks
Blood unripe: 36 sacks/day * 2 days = 72 sacks

Now, let's add the weekday and weekend totals for each type to get the weekly total:

Valencia ripe total: 450 + 150 = 600 sacks
Valencia unripe total: 190 + 66 = 256 sacks

Navel ripe total: 625 + 200 = 825 sacks
Navel unripe total: 325 + 114 = 439 sacks

Blood ripe total: 300 + 90 = 390 sacks
Blood unripe total: 210 + 72 = 282 sacks

Finally, let's calculate the difference between ripe and unripe oranges for each type:

Valencia difference: 600 - 256 = 344 sacks
Navel difference: 825 - 439 = 386 sacks
Blood difference: 390 - 282 = 108 sacks

Now, we add up the differences for all types to get the total difference:

Total difference = Valencia difference + Navel difference + Blood difference
Total difference = 344 + 386 + 108
Total difference = 838 sacks

So, the total difference between sacks of ripe and unripe oranges harvested in a week is 838 sacks.","We need to find the total difference in sacks between ripe and unripe oranges harvested in a week, considering the varying harvest rates.

Step 1: Calculate the total sacks harvested on weekdays and weekends for each type of orange.

- Valencia: Weekdays - 90 (ripe) + 38 (unripe) = 128; Weekend - 75 (ripe) + 33 (unripe) = 108.
- Navel: Weekdays - 125 (ripe) + 65 (unripe) = 190; Weekend - 100 (ripe) + 57 (unripe) = 157.
- Blood: Weekdays - 60 (ripe) + 42 (unripe) = 102; Weekend - 45 (ripe) + 36 (unripe) = 81.

Step 2: Calculate the total difference between ripe and unripe sacks for each day type.

- Weekday difference: 
    Valencia - 128 (ripe) - 108 (unripe) = 20
    Navel - 190 (ripe) - 157 (unripe) = 33
    Blood - 102 (ripe) - 81 (unripe) = 21

- Weekend difference: 
    Valencia - 108 (ripe) - 81 (unripe) = 27
    Navel - 157 (ripe) - 100 (unripe) = 57
    Blood - 81 (ripe) - 45 (unripe) = 36

Step 3: Sum up the differences for each day type to find the weekly total.

- Weekday total: 20 (Valencia) + 33 (Navel) + 21 (Blood) = 74
- Weekend total: 27 (Valencia) + 57 (Navel) + 36 (Blood) = 114

Step 4: Find the overall weekly difference.

  Total difference: 52 (weekday) - 42 (weekend) = 10 sacks

- Navel:
  Weekday: 125 (ripe) - 65 (unripe) = 60 sacks
  Weekend: 100 (ripe) - 57 (unripe) = 43 sacks
  Total difference: 60 (weekday) - 43 (weekend) = 17 sacks

- Blood:

291,"Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food to be added to the menu. If 324 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, 374 suggested adding bacon, and 128 suggested adding tomatoes, what percentage of the total amount of students does each food suggestion represent?","To find the percentage each food suggestion represents, we first need to find the total number of students who made suggestions. We do this by adding the number of students who suggested each type of food:

Total students = students who suggested mashed potatoes + students who suggested bacon + students who suggested tomatoes
Total students = 324 + 374 + 128
Total students = 826

Now, we can calculate the percentage each food suggestion represents out of the total number of students:

Percentage of students who suggested mashed potatoes = (Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes / Total students) * 100
Percentage of students who suggested mashed potatoes = (324 / 826) * 100
Percentage of students who suggested mashed potatoes ≈ 39.22%

Percentage of students who suggested bacon = (Number of students who suggested bacon / Total students) * 100
Percentage of students who suggested bacon = (374 / 826) * 100
Percentage of students who suggested bacon ≈ 45.28%

Percentage of students who suggested tomatoes = (Number of students who suggested tomatoes / Total students) * 100
Percentage of students who suggested tomatoes = (128 / 826) * 100
Percentage of students who suggested tomatoes ≈ 15.50%

So, approximately 39.22% of the students suggested adding mashed potatoes, 45.28% suggested adding bacon, and 15.50% suggested adding tomatoes.","We have 324 students suggesting mashed potatoes, 374 suggesting bacon, and 128 suggesting tomatoes. We get the total amount of students by adding these numbers together: 324 + 374 + 128 = 826.

Now, let's calculate the percentages for each suggestion:

1. Mashed potatoes: 324 / 826 x 100 = 39.48%

2. Bacon: 374 / 826 x 100 = 45.50%

3. Tomatoes: 128 / 826 x 100 = 15.59%

The final result is: 45%.","First, we need to find the total number of students who made suggestions. We do this by adding the number of students who suggested each food:

Total students = 324 (mashed potatoes) + 374 (bacon) + 128 (tomatoes)

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the total number of students that each food suggestion represents:

Percentage for mashed potatoes = (324 / 826) * 100%
Percentage for bacon = (374 / 826) * 100%
Percentage for tomatoes = (128 / 826) * 100%

Let's calculate the percentages:

Percentage for mashed potatoes = (324 / 826) * 100% ≈ 39.44%
Percentage for bacon = (374 / 826) * 100% ≈ 45.28%
Percentage for tomatoes = (128 / 826) * 100% ≈ 15.50%

293,"Lucy went to the grocery store and purchased items from different sections. She bought 4 packs of cookies, 18 packs of cakes, 10 packs of chips, and 6 bottles of soda. The cookies were on a buy-3-get-1-free sale, and the cakes had a 10% discount on each pack. Also, an additional 8% tax is applied on the total price. After paying, Lucy still had $35.62 remaining. Calculate the total number of packs and bottles Lucy bought and find out the original price of each item before discounts and taxes.","First, let's calculate the total number of packs and bottles Lucy bought:

- Cookies: 4 packs
- Cakes: 18 packs
- Chips: 10 packs
- Soda: 6 bottles

Total items = 4 + 18 + 10 + 6 = 38 items

Now, let's denote the original price of each item as follows:
- Cookies: C dollars per pack
- Cakes: K dollars per pack
- Chips: P dollars per pack
- Soda: S dollars per bottle

Lucy bought 4 packs of cookies, but due to the buy-3-get-1-free sale, she only paid for 3 packs. So, the cost for cookies is 3C.

For the cakes, she bought 18 packs with a 10% discount on each pack. The cost for cakes is 18K - 0.10 * 18K = 0.90 * 18K.

The cost for chips is straightforward, 10P, and for soda, it's 6S.

The total cost before tax is:
Total cost = 3C + 0.90 * 18K + 10P + 6S

After adding the 8% tax, the final cost is:
Final cost = Total cost + 0.08 * Total cost
Final cost = 1.08 * (3C + 0.90 * 18K + 10P + 6S)

We know that after paying, Lucy had $35.62 remaining. Let's assume Lucy had X dollars before shopping. So, the equation for the final cost is:
X - Final cost = $35.62

We need to find the original price of each item (C, K, P, S), but we have only one equation and four unknowns, which makes it impossible to solve without additional information. We need the original total amount Lucy had or the original prices of the items to find the exact values of C, K, P, and S.","Lucy bought 14 packs and 6 bottles in total. 

The original price of each item was $1.40.

$35.62","First, let's calculate the total number of packs and bottles Lucy bought:

- Cookies: 4 packs
- Cakes: 18 packs
- Chips: 10 packs
- Soda: 6 bottles

Total packs and bottles: 4 (cookies) + 18 (cakes) + 10 (chips) + 6 (soda) = 38 packs and bottles

Now, let's calculate the original price of each item before discounts and taxes:

- Cookies: Since Lucy bought 4 packs and they were on a buy-3-get-1-free sale, we need to find out the price of 3 packs. Let's assume the price of 1 pack is $x. Then the price of 3 packs would be 3x. Since Lucy got 1 pack free, we subtract the price of 1 pack from the total price of 3 packs: 3x - x = 2x.

- Cakes: Since Lucy bought 18 packs and each pack had a 10% discount, we need to find out the original price of 1 pack before the discount. Let's assume the original price of 1 pack is $y. Then the price of 18 packs would be 18y. After the 10% discount, the price would be 18y - 0.10 * 18y = 18y - 1.8y = 16.2y.

- Chips: Since Lucy bought 10 packs, we need to find out the original price of 1 pack. Let's assume the original price of 1 pack is $z. Then the price of 10 packs would be 10z.

- Soda: Since Lucy bought 6 bottles, we need to find out the original price of 1 bottle. Let's assume the original price of 1 bottle is $w. Then the price of 6 bottles would be 6w.

Now, let's calculate the total original price of all the items before discounts and taxes:

- Cookies: 2x
- Cakes: 16.2y
- Chips: 10z
- Soda: 6w

Total original price = 2x + 16.2y + 10z + 6w

We don't have the individual prices of each item, so we can't calculate the exact total original price. However, we can express the total original price as a function of the prices of the cookies, cakes, chips, and soda:

If Ron stands at 14.2 feet, how deep is the water?","First, we need to determine Dean's height. Since Dean is 8.3 feet shorter than Ron, we subtract 8.3 feet from Ron's height:

Dean's height = Ron's height - 8.3 feet
Dean's height = 14.2 feet - 8.3 feet
Dean's height = 5.9 feet

Now, we can calculate the depth of the water, which is 2.5 times Dean's height plus an additional 3 feet:

Depth of water = 2.5 * Dean's height + 3 feet
Depth of water = 2.5 * 5.9 feet + 3 feet
Depth of water = 14.75 feet + 3 feet
Depth of water = 17.75 feet

Alice has 35 of them. She will use the large bags first to minimize the number of bags.

For chocolate-chip cookies:
- Each large bag holds 15 cookies.
- She can fill 2 large bags with 15 cookies each, which accounts for 30 cookies (2 bags * 15 cookies/bag = 30 cookies).
- She will have 5 chocolate-chip cookies left (35 total - 30 packed = 5 left).
- She will need 1 small bag for the remaining 5 chocolate-chip cookies.

He bought a total of 12 candy bars, some of which are Type A and the rest are Type B. What is the amount he spent on each type of candy bar?","Let's denote the number of Type A candy bars Dan bought as A and the number of Type B candy bars as B. We have two pieces of information that can be turned into equations:

1. The total number of candy bars is 12:
   A + B = 12

2. The total amount spent is $20, with Type A bars costing $1.25 each and Type B bars costing $1.75 each:
   1.25A + 1.75B = 20

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve this system to find the values of A and B.

First, let's solve the first equation for A:
   A = 12 - B

Now we can substitute this expression for A into the second equation:
   1.25(12 - B) + 1.75B = 20

Expanding the equation, we get:
   15 - 1.25B + 1.75B = 20

Combining like terms, we get:
   15 + 0.5B = 20

Now, let's solve for B:
   0.5B = 20 - 15
   0.5B = 5
   B = 5 / 0.5
   B = 10

Now that we know B, we can find A:
   A = 12 - B
   A = 12 - 10
   A = 2

So, Dan bought 2 Type A candy bars and 10 Type B candy bars.

Now let's calculate the amount spent on each type of candy bar:
Amount spent on Type A candy bars:
   2 * $1.25 = $2.50

Amount spent on Type B candy bars:
   10 * $1.75 = $17.50

Therefore, Dan spent $2.50 on Type A candy bars and $17.50 on Type B candy bars.","Dan spent $8 on Type A candy bars and $16 on Type B candy bars. 

The total spent on both types combined is $24, which is more than Dan's total budget, so the scenario is unrealistic, but the individual prices of each type are within Dan's budget.

$8/$16.","Dan bought a total of 12 candy bars. Since he bought a combination of two types of candy bars, we can let the number of Type A candy bars be x and the number of Type B candy bars be 12 - x.

The total cost for the candy bars would be the sum of the cost of each type of candy bar multiplied by the number of that type of candy bar. So, the total cost would be:

Total cost = (cost of Type A candy bar * number of Type A candy bars) + (cost of Type B candy bar * number of Type B candy bars)

We know that the cost of Type A candy bar is $1.25 and the cost of Type B candy bar is $1.75. We also know that Dan has $20, so the total cost of the candy bars cannot exceed $20.

Let's set up the equation:

Total cost = ($1.25 * x) + ($1.75 * (12 - x))

Now, let's solve for x:

1) First, let's find the total cost for the Type B candy bars:

Total cost for Type B candy bars = $1.75 * (12 - x)
Total cost for Type B candy bars = $1.75 * 12 - $1.75 * x
Total cost for Type B candy bars = $21 - $1.75 * x

2) Now, let's find the total cost for the Type A candy bars:

Total cost for Type A candy bars = $1.25 * x

3) Finally, let's set the total cost equal to the amount Dan has, which is $20:

$20 = ($1.25 * x) + ($21 - $1.75 * x)

Now, let's solve for x:

$20 = $1.25 * x + $21 - $1.75 * x
$20 = $21 - $0.5 * x
$20 + $0.5 * x = $21
$20.5 * x = $21
x = $21 / $20.5
x = $1.02

Since Dan can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can round x to the nearest whole number. The nearest whole number that is less than or equal to $1.02 is 1.

So, Dan bought 1 Type A candy bar and 11 Type B candy bars.

The amount he spent on each type of candy bar is:

302,"For 19 weeks of harvest, Lewis earns a varied amount that totals $2,560. His earnings increase by $10 each week. Additionally, Lewis has weekly expenses of $25 for transport and pays an 8% income tax on his earnings. How much money did Lewis earn during his first week of harvest and what is his weekly net income after expenses and taxes for that first week?","Let's denote Lewis's earnings in the first week as ""E."" Since his earnings increase by $10 each week, his earnings in the second week would be E + $10, in the third week E + $20, and so on, until the 19th week, where his earnings would be E + $180 (since 18 weeks have passed, and the earnings increase by $10 each week).

The total earnings over the 19 weeks can be calculated by summing up the earnings for each week. This forms an arithmetic series with the first term E, the common difference $10, and the number of terms 19.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)

where n is the number of terms.

In this case, the last term is E + $180, and n is 19.

Sum = (19/2) * (E + (E + $180))
Sum = (19/2) * (2E + $180)
Sum = 19E + (19/2) * $180

We know the total sum is $2,560, so we can set up the equation:

19E + (19/2) * $180 = $2,560

Now, let's solve for E:

19E + $1,710 = $2,560
19E = $2,560 - $1,710
19E = $850
E = $850 / 19
E = $44.74 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, Lewis earned $44.74 during his first week of harvest.

Now, let's calculate his net income after expenses and taxes for that first week.

First, we subtract the weekly expenses of $25 from his first-week earnings:

Net income after expenses = E - $25
Net income after expenses = $44.74 - $25
Net income after expenses = $19.74

Next, we calculate the income tax, which is 8% of his earnings:

Income tax = 8% of E
Income tax = 0.08 * $44.74
Income tax = $3.58 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, we subtract the income tax from the net income after expenses to get his weekly net income:

Weekly net income = Net income after expenses - Income tax
Weekly net income = $19.74 - $3.58
Weekly net income = $16.16 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, Lewis's weekly net income after expenses and taxes for the first week is $16.16.","Lewis earned $130 during his first week of harvest. His weekly net income after expenses and taxes for that week was $91. 

$130.","Let's denote Lewis's earnings in the first week as \( E_1 \).

According to the information given, Lewis's earnings increase by $10 each week. So, in the second week, he earns \( E_1 + 10 \), in the third week, he earns \( E_1 + 20 \), and so on.

The total earnings over 19 weeks are given as $2,560. We can express this as a sum of the earnings from each week:

\[ 2,560 = E_1 + (E_1 + 10) + (E_1 + 20) + ... + (E_1 + 180) \]

To find \( E_1 \), we need to find the value of \( E_1 \) that makes the sum of the earnings from each week equal to $2,560.

Let's start by calculating the sum of the earnings from the first week to the 19th week:

\[ E_1 + (E_1 + 10) + (E_1 + 20) + ... + (E_1 + 180) = E_1 + 19 \times (E_1 + 10) \]

Now, let's find the common factor of the terms in the sum:

\[ E_1 + 10E_1 + 20E_1 + ... + 180E_1 = 19E_1 + 19 \times 10E_1 \]

\[ 19E_1 + 190E_1 = 209E_1 \]

\[ 209E_1 = 2,560 \]

\[ E_1 = \frac{2,560}{209} \]

\[ E_1 = 12.26 \]

Since Lewis's earnings increase by $10 each week, we can find the earnings for each week by adding $10 to the earnings of the previous week:

\[ E_2 = E_1 + 10 = 12.26 + 10 = 22.26 \]
\[ E_3 = E_2 + 10 = 22.26 + 10 = 32.26 \]
\[ E_4 = E_3 + 10 = 32.26 + 10 = 42.26 \]

And so on, until we reach the 19th week:

If Hailey did 10% fewer push-ups than the class average of 30 push-ups, how many push-ups did each of them do?","Let's start by calculating how many push-ups Hailey did. If the class average is 30 push-ups and Hailey did 10% fewer, then she did:

10% of 30 = 0.10 * 30 = 3 fewer push-ups than the average.

So, Hailey did 30 - 3 = 27 push-ups.

Now, we know that Zachary did twice as many push-ups as Hailey. So Zachary did:

2 * 27 = 54 push-ups.

If Zachary completed 68 push-ups, 130 crunches, and 58 squats, how many squats did David do?","First, let's find out how many push-ups David did. Since David completed 2 times more push-ups than Zachary, we can calculate this by:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups * 2
David's push-ups = 68 * 2
David's push-ups = 136

Now, we need to find the value of x for the crunches. Since David did x/2 less crunches than Zachary, we can set up the following equation:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - x/2
130 - x/2 = David's crunches

But we don't have the exact number of crunches David did, so we can't solve for x directly from this information. However, we can use the information about squats to find x.

Since David did 3 times the number of squats as x, we can write:

David's squats = 3x

We know that Zachary did 58 squats, so we can set up the equation:

3x = David's squats
x = Zachary's squats
x = 58

Now that we have the value of x, we can calculate the number of squats David did:

David's squats = 3x
David's squats = 3 * 58

Therefore, David did 174 squats.","Let's solve this fitness competition challenge!

David does 2 x 68 push-ups = 136 push-ups and x/2 less crunches than Zachary, which equals 130 / 2 = 65 crunches.

310,"Faye was placing her pencils, crayons, and markers into rows in a complex arrangement. She put 52 crayons in the first row, 76 pencils in the second row, then 40 markers in the third row. In the fourth row, she doubled the amount of crayons, and in the fifth row, she increased the number of pencils by 50%. The sixth row had 25% fewer markers than the third row. This pattern continued for a total of 30 rows. How many pencils did Faye place in this arrangement?","Let's break down the pattern and calculate the total number of pencils Faye placed in the arrangement.

First, we know that Faye placed 76 pencils in the second row. In the fifth row, she increased the number of pencils by 50%. To find out how many pencils are in the fifth row, we calculate 50% of 76 and add it to the original 76:

50% of 76 = 0.5 * 76 = 38
Pencils in the fifth row = 76 + 38 = 114

The pattern repeats every six rows, and there are a total of 30 rows. Since 30 is a multiple of 6, the pattern will repeat 30 / 6 = 5 times.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of pencils in all the pencil rows. There are two pencil rows in each pattern (second and fifth rows), so there will be 5 * 2 = 10 pencil rows in total.

The total number of pencils is the sum of the pencils in the second and fifth rows, multiplied by the number of times each occurs:

Total pencils = (Number of pencils in the second row * Number of second rows) + (Number of pencils in the fifth row * Number of fifth rows)
Total pencils = (76 * 5) + (114 * 5)
Total pencils = 380 + 570
Total pencils = 950

Faye placed a total of 950 pencils in the arrangement.","Faye's arrangement starts with 52 crayons, 76 pencils, and 40 markers. Each row increases complexity through calculations. 

The number of pencils in the second row is 76. Doubling the crayons in the fourth row brings it to 104. In the fifth row, 50% more pencils than the previous row results in 156 pencils. The sixth row has 25% fewer markers than the 40 in the third, making it 30. 

This pattern of increasing by 50% continues for the remainder of the rows. We can calculate the total number of pencils by starting with the initial 76 and applying a 50% increase for every row: 
76, 114, 171, 256, 384, 576... 

By row 30, the number of pencils Faye carefully placed in that row is a meticulous 5856.

Thus, the final answer is 5856.","Let's calculate the number of pencils Faye placed in each row:

- In the second row, she put 76 pencils.
- In the fifth row, she increased the number of pencils by 50%. So, the number of pencils in the fifth row is 76 * 1.5 = 114 pencils.
- In the sixth row, she doubled the amount of crayons, which is 52 * 2 = 104 crayons. Since the sixth row had 25% fewer markers than the third row, and the third row had 40 markers, the sixth row would have 40 - 25% of 40 = 40 - 0.25 * 40 = 40 - 10 = 30 markers.

Now, let's calculate the number of pencils in the sixth row:

- The sixth row had 104 crayons and 30 markers. Since the row is for pencils, we subtract the number of crayons and markers from the total number of items in the row to find the number of pencils: 104 (crayons) + 30 (markers) = 134 (total items).
- Now, we subtract the number of crayons and markers from the total number of items to find the number of pencils: 134 (total items) - 104 (crayons) - 30 (markers) = 100 pencils.

Faye placed 100 pencils in the sixth row.

Now, let's calculate the number of pencils in the remaining rows:

- In the seventh row, she doubled the amount of pencils, so it would be 114 * 2 = 228 pencils.
- In the eighth row, she doubled the amount of pencils again, so it would be 228 * 2 = 456 pencils.

This pattern of doubling the pencils in each row continues until the 30th row. To find the total number of pencils, we need to sum up the pencils in each row from the seventh row to the 30th row:

- Seventh row: 228 pencils
- Eighth row: 456 pencils
- Ninth row: 228 * 2 = 456 pencils
- Tenth row: 456 * 2 = 912 pencils
- Eleventh row: 912 * 2 = 1824 pencils

311,"Edward initially spent $40 on 100 books, each costing him the same amount of money. However, he received a 25% discount on the total cost. After purchasing the books, he also bought 3 pens, each costing $2. Now he has $6 left. How much money did Edward have before he spent it on the books and pens?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the books after the 25% discount.

The initial cost of the books was $40. A 25% discount on $40 is calculated as follows:
25% of $40 = (25/100) * $40 = $10

So, the discount amount is $10.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the initial cost to find the final cost of the books:
$40 - $10 = $30

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pens. Edward bought 3 pens, each costing $2:
3 pens * $2/pen = $6

Now, let's add the final cost of the books and the cost of the pens to find the total amount Edward spent:
$30 (books) + $6 (pens) = $36

Edward has $6 left after these purchases. To find out how much money Edward had before he spent it on the books and pens, we add the amount he spent to the amount he has left:
$36 (spent) + $6 (left) = $42

Therefore, Edward had $42 before he spent it on the books and pens.","Edward's initial amount of money = $40 for the books + cost of 3 pens + $6 remaining
$40 + 3 × $2 + $6 = $54.

The final result is Fifty-four dollars.","Let's denote the cost of each book as B. Since all books cost the same amount, we can say that 100 books cost 100B.

Edward received a 25% discount on the total cost, so the total cost before the discount was 125% of the cost of the books, which is 1.25 * 100B.

After the discount, the total cost became 100B - 0.25 * 100B = 0.75 * 100B = 75B.

We know that Edward spent $40 on the books, so we can set up the equation:

75B = $40

Now, we can solve for B:

B = $40 / 75
B = $0.5333...

Since the cost of each book is not likely to be a fraction of a dollar, we can round B to the nearest cent. Since $0.5333... is closer to $0.53 than $0.54, we'll round B to $0.53.

Now we know that each book cost $0.53. Since Edward bought 100 books, the total cost for the books is:

100 * $0.53 = $53

After purchasing the books, Edward had $6 left. This means that before purchasing the books, he had:

$6 + $53 = $59

Now, let's consider the cost of the pens. Edward bought 3 pens, each costing $2. So the total cost for the pens is:

3 * $2 = $6

Before purchasing the pens, Edward had $59, and after purchasing the pens, he had $6 left. So the total amount he had before purchasing the pens was:

$59 + $6 = $65

Therefore, Edward had $65 before he spent it on the books and pens.",Fifty-four,$65,$42

314,Mia has twice as many apples as Steven and 3 more peaches than Jake. Jake has 3 fewer peaches and 4 more apples than Steven. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches. What is the total difference in the number of apples and peaches for all three individuals?,"Let's start by calculating the number of apples and peaches each person has.

Steven has:
- 19 apples
- 15 peaches

Mia has twice as many apples as Steven and 3 more peaches than Jake. So Mia has:
- 2 * 19 apples = 38 apples
- We don't know how many peaches Jake has yet, so we can't calculate Mia's peaches at this moment.

Jake has 3 fewer peaches and 4 more apples than Steven. So Jake has:
- 19 apples + 4 apples = 23 apples
- 15 peaches - 3 peaches = 12 peaches

Now we can calculate Mia's peaches since we know Jake has 12 peaches:
- 12 peaches + 3 peaches = 15 peaches

Now let's calculate the total number of apples and peaches for each person:
- Steven: 19 apples + 15 peaches = 34
- Mia: 38 apples + 15 peaches = 53
- Jake: 23 apples + 12 peaches = 35

The total number of fruits for all three individuals is:
- Steven + Mia + Jake = 34 + 53 + 35 = 122

The total difference in the number of apples and peaches for all three individuals is the sum of their individual totals, which is 122.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches.

2. As Mia has twice the amount of apples as Steven, she has 2 x 19 = 38 apples. And as she has 3 more peaches than Jake, and Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, Mia has 15 + 3 = 18 peaches.

3. Next, we'll find the total number of fruits held by Steven. His total is 19 apples + 15 peaches = 34 fruits.

4. Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 15 - 3 = 12 peaches. And as Jake has 4 fewer apples than Steven, he has 19 - 4 = 15 apples. Jake's total is now 27.

5. Now, we'll calculate the total number of fruits for Mia. Her total is 38 apples + 18 peaches = 56 fruits.

6. The total difference in the number of apples and peaches among the three individuals is then (56 - 34) + (27 - 34) = 22 + 3 = 25. 

So the final result is **25**.","Let's start by finding out how many apples and peaches each individual has.

Jake has 4 more apples than Steven, so he has 19 + 4 = 23 apples.

Now, let's find out how many peaches Mia has. She has 3 more peaches than Jake, so she has 12 + 3 = 15 peaches.

Now, let's calculate the total difference in the number of apples and peaches for all three individuals.

The total difference in apples is:
Mia's apples - Steven's apples = 38 - 19 = 19 apples

316,"Julia played tag with a total of 18 kids on two different days. She played with 4 kids on Monday for 30 minutes, and she played with some more kids on Tuesday for 45 minutes. On Monday, each kid ran at a speed of 5 km/h, while on Tuesday, some kids ran faster at a speed of 7 km/h and the remaining kids ran at a speed of 5 km/h. The number of kids running at different speeds resulted in them covering different distances. If the kids running at 7 km/h covered a total distance of 31.5 km on Tuesday, how many kids did Julia play with on Tuesday, and how many of them ran at each speed?","Let's start by calculating the total distance covered by the kids on Monday. Since they all ran at a speed of 5 km/h for 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), we can calculate the distance each kid covered and then multiply by the number of kids.

Distance covered by each kid on Monday = Speed × Time
Distance covered by each kid on Monday = 5 km/h × 0.5 h = 2.5 km

Since Julia played with 4 kids on Monday, the total distance covered by all kids on Monday is:
Total distance on Monday = Distance per kid × Number of kids
Total distance on Monday = 2.5 km × 4 = 10 km

Now, let's move on to Tuesday. We know that some kids ran at 7 km/h and covered a total distance of 31.5 km. Let's find out how many kids ran at this speed.

First, we calculate the distance covered by each kid running at 7 km/h in 45 minutes (which is 0.75 hours):
Distance covered by each kid at 7 km/h on Tuesday = Speed × Time
Distance covered by each kid at 7 km/h on Tuesday = 7 km/h × 0.75 h = 5.25 km

Now, we can find out the number of kids who ran at 7 km/h:
Number of kids at 7 km/h = Total distance at 7 km/h / Distance per kid at 7 km/h
Number of kids at 7 km/h = 31.5 km / 5.25 km = 6

Now we know that 6 kids ran at 7 km/h on Tuesday. To find out the total number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday, we need to consider the remaining kids who ran at 5 km/h.

Let's denote the number of kids who ran at 5 km/h on Tuesday as x. Since the total number of kids Julia played with on both days is 18, and we already know she played with 4 kids on Monday and 6 kids at 7 km/h on Tuesday, we can write the following equation:

4 (kids on Monday) + 6 (kids at 7 km/h on Tuesday) + x (kids at 5 km/h on Tuesday) = 18

Now we solve for x:
4 + 6 + x = 18
10 + x = 18
x = 18 - 10
x = 8

So, Julia played with 8 kids who ran at 5 km/h on Tuesday.

In summary, on Tuesday, Julia played with a total of 6 + 8 = 14 kids, with 6 of them running at 7 km/h and 8 of them running at 5 km/h.","Julia played with 9 kids on Tuesday. 5 of them ran at 7 km/h while the other 4 ran at 5 km/h.

**9 kids**","Let's denote the number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday as \( x \).

On Tuesday, the kids ran at two different speeds: 7 km/h and 5 km/h. Let's denote the number of kids running at 7 km/h as \( y \) and the number of kids running at 5 km/h as \( z \). We know that \( y + z = x \).

The total distance covered by the kids running at 7 km/h is given as 31.5 km. To find the number of kids running at 7 km/h, we can use the formula for distance:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

We know the distance and the speed, so we can find the time:

\[ 31.5 \text{ km} = 7 \text{ km/h} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{31.5 \text{ km}}{7 \text{ km/h}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know that Julia played with these kids for 45 minutes on Tuesday. To find the number of kids running at 7 km/h, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes:

\[ 4.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \times 60 \text{ minutes} \]

\[ 4.5 \times 60 = 270 \text{ minutes} \]

Now we have the time in minutes, which matches the time Julia played on Tuesday. So, the number of kids running at 7 km/h is \( y = 270 \text{ minutes} / 45 \text{ minutes per kid} = 6 \text{ kids} \).

Since we know that \( y + z = x \), we can find the number of kids running at 5 km/h by subtracting the number of kids running at 7 km/h from the total number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday:

\[ z = x - y \]

\[ z = 18 \text{ kids} - 6 \text{ kids} \]

\[ z = 12 \text{ kids} \]

So, Julia played with 12 kids running at 5 km/h on Tuesday. In total, Julia played with \( x = y + z = 6 \text{ kids} + 12 \text{ kids} = 18 \text{ kids} \) on Tuesday.",9,eighteen,Fourteen.
317,"Paul originally had 250 books. After selling some books in a garage sale, donating 50 books to a library, exchanging 20 books for new ones, and giving 35 books to his friend, he had 102 books left. How many books did he sell in the garage sale?","Let's calculate the total number of books Paul got rid of, excluding the ones he sold in the garage sale.

He donated 50 books to a library.
He exchanged 20 books, but since he got new ones in return, this doesn't change the total count.
He gave 35 books to his friend.

So, the total number of books he got rid of without selling is 50 (donated) + 35 (given to a friend) = 85 books.

Now, let's find out how many books he had before the garage sale:

He had 250 books originally.
He got rid of 85 books (donated and given away).
He had 102 books left after all transactions.

So, before the garage sale, he had 250 - 85 = 165 books.

After the garage sale, he had 102 books left. Therefore, the number of books he sold in the garage sale is:

165 (books before the garage sale) - 102 (books left after all transactions) = 63 books sold in the garage sale.","Paul had 102 books remaining after all the transactions. We know he also got rid of 50 books by donating them, exchanged 20, and gave 35 to his friend. So to find the number of books sold in the garage sale, we need to subtract the sum of these three numbers from the initial 250 books: 
250 - (50 + 20 + 35) = 145 books. 

The result is 145.","Let's denote the number of books Paul sold in the garage sale as \( x \).

According to the information given, Paul originally had 250 books. After the garage sale, he had 102 books left. So, the total number of books he had after the garage sale is:

\( 250 - x \)

Paul also donated 50 books to a library, exchanged 20 books for new ones, and gave 35 books to his friend. These actions are not related to the garage sale, so we don't need to consider them when calculating the number of books sold.

After all these actions, Paul had 102 books left. So, the total number of books he had after the garage sale and these other actions is:

\( 250 - x + 50 + 20 + 35 = 102 \)

Now, we can set up the equation:

\( 250 - x + 50 + 20 + 35 = 102 \)

Combine like terms:

\( 250 - x + 85 = 102 \)

Now, subtract 250 from both sides:

\( -x + 85 = 102 - 250 \)

Subtract 85 from both sides:

\( -x = 102 - 250 - 85 \)

\( -x = -143 \)

Now, divide both sides by -1 to solve for \( x \):

\( x = \frac{-143}{-1} \)

\( x = 143 \)

Now he has 67 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did Danny have at first?","Let's calculate the number of bottle caps Danny had at first step by step.

First, we need to account for the bottle caps he threw away and the new ones he found. He threw away 60 and found 58, so the net change in his collection from this activity is:
58 (found) - 60 (thrown away) = -2 bottle caps

Next, we consider the trade he made with his friends. He traded away 15 bottle caps but received 25 in return, so the net change from the trade is:
25 (received) - 15 (traded away) = +10 bottle caps

Now, let's add these net changes to his final count to find out how many he had at first. He ended up with 67 bottle caps after all these transactions. So, working backwards:

67 (final count) - 10 (net gain from trade) = 57 bottle caps
57 (after trade adjustment) + 2 (net loss from throwing away and finding) = 59 bottle caps

Therefore, Danny had 59 bottle caps at first before he threw away, found, and traded any bottle caps.","Danny had 70 bottle caps initially.

**70**","Danny started with a certain number of bottle caps. He threw away 60 old ones, found 58 new ones, traded 15 of his bottle caps for 25 new ones, and ended up with 67 bottle caps.

320,"Mary is baking a cake with a unique flavor profile. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, 8 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt, maintaining a specific sugar-to-salt ratio. Mary already added 5 cups of flour and accidentally added an additional 2 cups of sugar to the mix. In order to preserve the appropriate sugar-to-salt ratio while accounting for the extra sugar, how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?","First, let's find the original sugar-to-salt ratio in the recipe. The recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt, so the ratio is 8:7.

Mary has already added 2 extra cups of sugar, so she has added a total of 10 cups of sugar so far. To maintain the sugar-to-salt ratio of 8:7, we need to calculate how much salt would correspond to 10 cups of sugar.

Using the ratio, we can set up a proportion:

8 cups sugar / 7 cups salt = 10 cups sugar / x cups salt

Cross-multiply to solve for x:

8x = 10 * 7
8x = 70
x = 70 / 8
x = 8.75 cups of salt

Since Mary needs to maintain the ratio and has already added 10 cups of sugar, she would need to add 8.75 cups of salt to maintain the ratio. However, she has not added any salt yet.

Now, let's find out how much more sugar and salt she needs to add to complete the recipe, considering she has already added 10 cups of sugar and needs to add a total of 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt as per the original recipe.

For sugar:
She needs to add 8 cups (as per the recipe) - 10 cups (already added) = -2 cups
Since she can't remove sugar, she has to adjust the salt accordingly.

For salt:
She needs to add 8.75 cups (to match the 10 cups of sugar she has added) - 0 cups (already added) = 8.75 cups

So, Mary needs to add 8.75 cups of salt to maintain the ratio with the 10 cups of sugar she has already added.

To answer the question of how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add now, since she has already added too much sugar, she doesn't need to add more sugar, only salt. Therefore, she needs to add 8.75 cups of salt and no more sugar. The difference is -8.75 cups, meaning she needs to add 8.75 cups more salt than sugar now.","Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar beyond what the recipe requires, so she needs to add an extra cup of sugar to maintain the sugar-to-salt ratio. 

The final result is one cup.","First, let's find out the sugar-to-salt ratio that Mary is aiming for. We know that the recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. To find the ratio, we divide the amount of sugar by the amount of salt:

8 cups of sugar ÷ 7 cups of salt = 1.142857142857143 (approximately)

Now, let's find out how much sugar Mary has already added. She has added 5 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar, so:

5 cups of flour + 2 cups of sugar = 7 cups of sugar (approximately)

Mary has already added 7 cups of sugar, which is more than the 8 cups the recipe calls for. This means she has added too much sugar. To find out how much sugar she has added in excess, we subtract the amount of sugar the recipe calls for from the amount she has already added:

7 cups of sugar (already added) - 8 cups of sugar (called for) = -1 cup of sugar (excess sugar)

Now, let's find out how much salt she needs to add to maintain the appropriate sugar-to-salt ratio. We know that the ratio is approximately 1.142857142857143, so we multiply the amount of sugar she has already added by the ratio:

7 cups of sugar (already added) × 1.142857142857143 (ratio) = 8 cups of salt (approximately)

Mary has already added 7 cups of sugar, so she needs to add 1 more cup of sugar to reach the 8 cups the recipe calls for. However, since she has already added too much sugar, we need to subtract the excess sugar from the amount of sugar she needs to add:

8 cups of sugar (called for) - 1 cup of sugar (excess sugar) = 7 cups of sugar (to be added)

Now, let's find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add. We know that the recipe calls for 7 cups of salt, so we subtract the amount of salt she has already added from the amount of salt the recipe calls for:

7 cups of salt (called for) - 0 cups of salt (already added) = 7 cups of salt (to be added)

Since Mary has already added 0 cups of salt, she needs to add 7 cups of salt to reach the 7 cups the recipe calls for.

Now, let's compare the amount of sugar she needs to add (7 cups) to the amount of salt she needs to add (7 cups):

321,"In Jerry's room, there was a shelf with 2 action figures, 10 books, 6 video games, and 3 DVDs. Later, he added 4 more action figures and bought 3 new books, 2 new video games, and 1 new DVD. If Jerry decided to rearrange his shelf so that every 3 books take up the same space as 1 video game and every 2 DVDs take up the space of 1 action figure, how many video game equivalents are there on the shelf after rearranging it, and how many video game equivalents more than action figure equivalents does Jerry have?","First, let's calculate the total number of each item Jerry has after adding the new ones:

Action figures: 2 (original) + 4 (new) = 6 action figures
Books: 10 (original) + 3 (new) = 13 books
Video games: 6 (original) + 2 (new) = 8 video games
DVDs: 3 (original) + 1 (new) = 4 DVDs

Now, let's convert the books and DVDs into their video game and action figure equivalents:

Since every 3 books take up the same space as 1 video game, we divide the number of books by 3 to find the video game equivalent:
13 books / 3 books per video game = 4.33 video game equivalents (we'll keep the fraction for now)

Since every 2 DVDs take up the space of 1 action figure, we divide the number of DVDs by 2 to find the action figure equivalent:
4 DVDs / 2 DVDs per action figure = 2 action figure equivalents

Now, let's calculate the total number of video game equivalents on the shelf:

Video game equivalents from video games: 8 (since each video game is equivalent to itself)
Video game equivalents from books: 4.33 (from the calculation above)

Total video game equivalents = 8 + 4.33 = 12.33 video game equivalents

Next, let's calculate the total number of action figure equivalents on the shelf:

Action figure equivalents from action figures: 6 (since each action figure is equivalent to itself)
Action figure equivalents from DVDs: 2 (from the calculation above)

Total action figure equivalents = 6 + 2 = 8 action figure equivalents

Finally, let's find out how many more video game equivalents than action figure equivalents Jerry has:

12.33 video game equivalents - 8 action figure equivalents = 4.33 more video game equivalents than action figure equivalents

So, there are 12.33 video game equivalents on the shelf after rearranging, and Jerry has 4.33 more video game equivalents than action figure equivalents.","First, calculate the total number of action figure equivalents: there are 2 + 4 = 6 action figures, which equal 3 DVDs.

The number of book equivalents can be found by dividing the total number of books by 3: 10 / 3 = 3.33..., which means Jerry has 3 book equivalents.

The number of video games is 6, which we'll compare this to the action figure equivalents later. 

Next, we'll calculate the total number of equivalents by adding the book and video game equivalents: 3 + 6 = 9 equivalents.

Therefore, the difference between the number of video game equivalents and action figure equivalents is 6 - 3 = 3.

Jerry has three more video game equivalents than action figure equivalents on his shelf after rearranging his belongings.","First, let's calculate the number of video game equivalents Jerry has after rearranging his shelf.

According to the information given, every 3 books take up the space of 1 video game. Jerry has 10 books, so we divide the number of books by 3 to find out how many video game equivalents there are:

10 books ÷ 3 books/video game = 3.33 video game equivalents

Since we can't have a fraction of a video game equivalent, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3 video game equivalents.

Now, let's calculate the number of action figure equivalents Jerry has after rearranging his shelf.

According to the information given, every 2 DVDs take up the space of 1 action figure. Jerry has 3 DVDs, so we divide the number of DVDs by 2 to find out how many action figure equivalents there are:

3 DVDs ÷ 2 DVDs/action figure = 1.5 action figure equivalents

Since we can't have a fraction of an action figure equivalent, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 action figure equivalent.

322,"Lewis earns $28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. He also earns $939 per week for working overtime, and he works overtime every week. Additionally, Lewis receives a performance-based weekly bonus that ranges from $50 to $150. If his bonus varies each week and he works overtime every week, how much money does he earn during the harvest season, assuming the minimum and maximum possible weekly bonus amounts?","First, let's calculate Lewis's earnings without the bonus.

Lewis earns $28 every week during the harvest, and he works for 1091 weeks. So, without overtime or bonuses, he would earn:
$28/week * 1091 weeks = $30,548

Lewis also earns $939 per week for working overtime, and he works overtime every week. So, his overtime earnings for the harvest season would be:
$939/week * 1091 weeks = $1,024,349

Now, let's calculate the total earnings with the minimum and maximum possible weekly bonuses.

Minimum bonus scenario:
Lewis receives a minimum bonus of $50 every week. So, his total bonus earnings for the harvest season would be:
$50/week * 1091 weeks = $54,550

Maximum bonus scenario:
Lewis receives a maximum bonus of $150 every week. So, his total bonus earnings for the harvest season would be:
$150/week * 1091 weeks = $163,650

Minimum bonus total earnings:
$30,548 (base earnings) + $1,024,349 (overtime earnings) + $54,550 (minimum bonus) = $1,109,447

Maximum bonus total earnings:
$30,548 (base earnings) + $1,024,349 (overtime earnings) + $163,650 (maximum bonus) = $1,218,547

Therefore, Lewis would earn between $1,109,447 and $1,218,547 during the harvest season, depending on his weekly bonus.","Lewis' weekly income is $28 + $939 + $50 = $1017 at the minimum and $28 + $939 + $150 = $1107 at the maximum. 

For the entire harvest season, the total amounts would be $1017 x 1091 = $1,110,687 at the minimum and $1107 x 1091 = $1,208,817 at the maximum. 

Therefore, the total amount earned is either **one million one hundred and seventeen thousand six hundred and seventy-seven dollars** or **one million two hundred and eight thousand eight hundred and seventeen dollars**.","First, let's calculate the total amount Lewis earns from his regular work during the harvest season. Since he earns $28 every week for 1091 weeks, we can multiply these two numbers together to get the total:

$28/week * 1091 weeks = $29,948

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lewis earns from working overtime during the harvest season. Since he earns $939 per week and works overtime every week, we can multiply these two numbers together to get the total:

$939/week * 1091 weeks = $993,249

Next, let's calculate the minimum and maximum possible weekly bonuses Lewis could receive. Since the bonus varies from $50 to $150 per week, we can multiply the minimum and maximum bonus amounts by the number of weeks to get the total minimum and maximum possible bonuses:

Minimum bonus: $50/week * 1091 weeks = $54,550
Maximum bonus: $150/week * 1091 weeks = $163,650

Now, let's add up all the amounts Lewis earns during the harvest season, including the minimum and maximum possible bonuses:

Total earnings = Regular work earnings + Overtime earnings + Minimum bonus + Maximum bonus
Total earnings = $29,948 + $993,249 + $54,550 + $163,650
Total earnings = $1,270,397 + $54,550
Total earnings = $1,324,947

So, Lewis earns a minimum of $1,324,947 during the harvest season, assuming the minimum possible weekly bonus amount. If we consider the maximum possible weekly bonus amount, his earnings would be:

Total earnings = $29,948 + $993,249 + $163,650
Total earnings = $1,270,397 + $163,650
Total earnings = $1,434,047

Therefore, Lewis earns a maximum of $1,434,047 during the harvest season, assuming the maximum possible weekly bonus amount.","1117677

She has already completed 15 pages. To find out how many pages she still has to finish, we subtract the number of pages she has completed from the total number of pages:

25 pages (total) - 15 pages (completed) = 10 pages (remaining)

So, Rachel still has 10 pages of homework to finish.

To find out how many pages she should finish per day at minimum, we divide the remaining number of pages by the number of days she has to complete them:

How many more green fruits (peaches and apples combined) are there compared to red peaches, and how many fewer yellow apples are there compared to green peaches?","To find out how many more green fruits there are compared to red peaches, we first need to calculate the total number of green fruits. We have 11 green peaches and 15 green apples, so:

Total green fruits = Green peaches + Green apples
Total green fruits = 11 + 15
Total green fruits = 26

Now, we compare this to the number of red peaches:

More green fruits than red peaches = Total green fruits - Red peaches
More green fruits than red peaches = 26 - 5
More green fruits than red peaches = 21

So, there are 21 more green fruits than red peaches.

To find out how many fewer yellow apples there are compared to green peaches, we compare the number of yellow apples to the number of green peaches:

Fewer yellow apples than green peaches = Green peaches - Yellow apples
Fewer yellow apples than green peaches = 11 - 8
Fewer yellow apples than green peaches = 3

How long is his hair now?","First, we need to calculate how much Robin's hair grew over the 6 months. If his hair was initially 14 inches long and it grew 20% longer, we can calculate the growth as follows:

Growth = Initial length × Growth percentage
Growth = 14 inches × 20%
Growth = 14 inches × 0.20
Growth = 2.8 inches

Now, we add the growth to the initial length to find the new length of Robin's hair after 6 months:

New length = Initial length + Growth
New length = 14 inches + 2.8 inches
New length = 16.8 inches

After his hair grew to 16.8 inches, Robin decides to cut off 13 inches. We subtract the amount cut from the new length to find the final length of his hair:

Final length = New length - Amount cut
Final length = 16.8 inches - 13 inches
Final length = 3.8 inches

So, after cutting off 13 inches, Robin's hair is now 3.8 inches long.","Robin's hair was 14 inches long, and over 6 months, it grew 20% longer: 14 + 2.8 = 16.8 inches. After the cut, his hair is 16.8 - 13 = 3.8 inches long. 

Short.","Robin's hair initially grew 20% longer, which means it grew 20% of 14 inches. To calculate this, we multiply 14 by 0.20:

How many more pastries than cakes did baker make and sell, taking into account the pies as a variable?","First, let's calculate the difference between the number of pastries and cakes that the baker made:

Pastries made: 250
Cakes made: 45
Difference (Pastries - Cakes): 250 - 45 = 205

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of pastries and cakes that the baker sold:

Pastries sold: 425
Cakes sold: 150
Difference (Pastries - Cakes): 425 - 150 = 275

Now, let's consider the pies as a variable. Since we are asked to find out how many more pastries than cakes the baker made and sold, taking into account the pies as a variable, we need to compare the differences in the context of pies.

Pies made: 75
Pies sold: 35

However, since we are only comparing pastries and cakes, the number of pies made and sold does not directly affect the difference between pastries and cakes. The pies act as a separate category and do not influence the calculation of the difference between pastries and cakes.

Therefore, the baker made 205 more pastries than cakes and sold 275 more pastries than cakes. The pies do not change these differences.","The baker made 25 cakes and 125 pastries more than he sold. 

He made 45 - 150 = 25 excess cakes and 250 - 425 = 125 excess pastries. 

The number of pies doesn't affect the difference in the number of cakes and pastries, as they were not mentioned in the initial scenario.

Therefore the result is 125.","First, let's find out how many more pastries than cakes the baker made:

The baker made 250 pastries, so we subtract the number of cakes made from the number of pastries made to find out how many more pastries than cakes he made:

250 pastries - 45 cakes = 205 more pastries than cakes made.

Now, let's find out how many more pastries than cakes the baker sold:

The baker sold 425 pastries, so we subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of pastries sold to find out how many more pastries than cakes he sold:

425 pastries - 150 cakes = 275 more pastries than cakes sold.

Since we are taking into account the pies as a variable, we need to consider the number of pies sold. The baker sold 35 pies. We need to find out how many more pastries than cakes the baker sold, taking into account the pies as a variable.

To do this, we subtract the number of pies sold from the number of pastries sold, and then subtract the result from the number of pastries sold:

425 pastries - 35 pies = 390 pastries.

Now, we subtract the number of pies sold from the number of cakes sold, and then subtract the result from the number of cakes sold:

328,"Dan has $50. He went to a store to buy candies and chocolates. The price of each candy bar is $4, but there is a discount of 20% off if he buys 3 or more. He decided to buy 5 candy bars. Chocolates are priced at $6 each, with an additional 5% tax on every chocolate purchase. Dan bought 4 chocolates. How much more money did Dan spend on chocolates than on candy bars?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the candy bars. 

The price of each candy bar is $4. Since Dan is buying 5 candy bars, the total cost without the discount would be:
5 candy bars * $4/candy bar = $20

However, there is a 20% discount because he is buying 3 or more candy bars. To find the discount amount:
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost without the discount to find the total cost with the discount:
$20 - $4 = $16

So, Dan spends $16 on candy bars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the chocolates.

The price of each chocolate is $6. Dan bought 4 chocolates, so the total cost without tax would be:
4 chocolates * $6/chocolate = $24

Now, we need to add the 5% tax to the total cost of the chocolates:
5% of $24 = 0.05 * $24 = $1.20

Add the tax to the total cost without tax to find the total cost with tax:
$24 + $1.20 = $25.20

So, Dan spends $25.20 on chocolates.

To find out how much more Dan spent on chocolates than on candy bars, subtract the total cost of candy bars from the total cost of chocolates:
$25.20 (chocolates) - $16 (candy bars) = $9.20

Dan spent $9.20 more on chocolates than on candy bars.","1. The discount for candy bars makes each one cost $3.20.

2. With the tax, each chocolate costs $6.30.

3. The cost of candy bars is $16 (5 x $3.20), and the cost of chocolates is $25.20 (4 x $6.30), so Dan spent $9.20 more on chocolates. 

Nine dollars and twenty cents.","First, let's calculate the total cost of the candy bars. Since Dan bought 5 candy bars and there is a 20% discount if he buys 3 or more, we need to calculate the discount for each candy bar.

The discount for each candy bar is 20% of $4, which is 0.20 * $4 = $0.80.

So, the cost of each candy bar after the discount is $4 - $0.80 = $3.20.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the candy bars:
5 candy bars * $3.20 each = $16.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the chocolates. The chocolates are priced at $6 each, and there is an additional 5% tax on every chocolate purchase.

The tax for each chocolate is 5% of $6, which is 0.05 * $6 = $0.30.

So, the cost of each chocolate after the tax is $6 + $0.30 = $6.30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the chocolates:
4 chocolates * $6.30 each = $25.20.

Finally, let's find out how much more money Dan spent on chocolates than on candy bars:

329,"Dan had $45 at the start. He went shopping and bought four candy bars and a toy car. The candy bars cost $4 each and the toy car was priced at $15, but he was able to get a 10% discount on it. He also had to pay a 5% sales tax on all items he bought. How much money did Dan have left after shopping?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $4 and he bought four, the total cost for the candy bars is:

4 candy bars * $4/candy bar = $16

Next, let's calculate the cost of the toy car after the 10% discount. The toy car is priced at $15, so the discount amount is:

10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Subtracting the discount from the original price of the toy car gives us:

$15 - $1.50 = $13.50

Now, let's add the cost of the candy bars and the discounted toy car to get the subtotal before tax:

$16 (candy bars) + $13.50 (toy car) = $29.50

Next, we need to calculate the sales tax on the subtotal. The sales tax rate is 5%, so:

5% of $29.50 = 0.05 * $29.50 = $1.475

Since sales tax is usually rounded to the nearest cent, we'll round $1.475 to $1.48.

Now, let's add the sales tax to the subtotal to get the total cost:

$29.50 (subtotal) + $1.48 (sales tax) = $30.98

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from Dan's initial amount of money to find out how much he has left:

$45 (initial amount) - $30.98 (total cost) = $14.02

Dan has $14.02 left after shopping.","Dan started with $45. He spent $4 x 4 = $16 on candy bars. The toy car originally cost $15 but Dan got a $1.50 discount on it as 10% of $15 is 0.10 x 15 = $1.50. So the car cost him $15 - $1.50 = $13.50.

The total cost of the items was $16 + $13.50 = $29.50. Sales tax on these items comes to $29.50 x 0.05 = $1.48.

So Dan had $45 - $29.50 - $1.48 = $14.02 left after shopping.

$14.02 is the final answer.","First, let's calculate the total cost of the candy bars:

Total cost of candy bars = 4 candy bars * $4 each = $16

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the toy car:

Discount on toy car = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50
Discounted price of toy car = $15 - $1.50 = $13.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items before tax:

Total cost before tax = Cost of candy bars + Discounted price of toy car = $16 + $13.50 = $29.50

Now, let's calculate the sales tax:

Sales tax = 5% of total cost before tax = 0.05 * $29.50 = $1.475

Since we can't have a fraction of a cent for the tax, we'll round it to the nearest cent:

Sales tax = $1.48

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Dan paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before tax + Sales tax = $29.50 + $1.48 = $30.98

Now, let's find out how much money Dan has left:

If Ron stands 13 feet tall at point A and experiences a 4-feet increase in height due to the tide effects at point B, calculate the depth of the water at both points A and B.","First, let's calculate Ron's height at point A and point B.

At point A:
Ron's height is given as 13 feet.

At point B:
Ron's height increases by 4 feet due to the tide effects. So, Ron's height at point B will be 13 feet + 4 feet = 17 feet.

Now, let's calculate the depth of the water at both points using the function D(x) = 16x, where x is Ron's height at a specific swimming area.

At point A:
D(x) = 16 * Ron's height at point A
D(x) = 16 * 13
D(x) = 208 feet

So, the depth of the water at point A is 208 feet.

At point B:
D(x) = 16 * Ron's height at point B
D(x) = 16 * 17
D(x) = 272 feet

So, the depth of the water at point B is 272 feet.","Ron's height is 13 feet at point A, and since we're told he is the shortest of the three friends, we can deduce that Dean stands 9 feet taller, which makes Dean 22 feet tall. Alex, in turn, is 5 feet shorter than Dean, which means he's 17 feet tall. 

The depth of the water at point A is given by the function D(x) = 16x, so we can calculate: 
D(A) = 16 * 13 = 208 feet

At point B, the tide effect increases Ron's height by 4 feet, making him 17 feet tall. Using Dean's height difference to Ron's new height (9 feet taller), we can determine that at point B, Dean stands at 26 feet and Alex stands 21 feet tall.

The depth of the water at point B is then:
D(B) = 16 * 17 = 272 feet

The change in depth between points A and B is a difference of 64 feet.

**272 feet**","First, let's find out the heights of Dean and Alex based on Ron's height.

Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, so if Ron is 13 feet tall, Dean would be 13 + 9 = 22 feet tall.

Alex is 5 feet shorter than Dean, so if Dean is 22 feet tall, Alex would be 22 - 5 = 17 feet tall.

Now, let's calculate the depths of the water at points A and B using the function D(x) = 16x, where x is Ron's height.

At point A, Ron's height is 13 feet, so the depth of the water is D(13) = 16 * 13 = 208 feet.

At point B, Ron's height is increased by 4 feet due to the tide effects, so his new height is 13 + 4 = 17 feet.

Now, let's calculate the depth of the water at point B using the new height:
D(17) = 16 * 17 = 272 feet.

For the cookies:
Total weight of cookies = Number of packs * Weight per pack
Total weight of cookies = 4 packs * 1.5 pounds/pack
Total weight of cookies = 6 pounds

332,"Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour, 7 cups of sugar, and 5 cups of unsweetened cocoa powder. The proportion of flour to sugar to cocoa powder should always remain constant. Mary has already put in some cups of flour and sugar, and she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar and 1 more cup of sugar than cocoa powder. How many cups of flour did she put in?","Let's denote the number of cups of flour Mary has already put in as F, the number of cups of sugar as S, and the number of cups of cocoa powder as C.

According to the problem, Mary needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, and 1 more cup of sugar than cocoa powder. This gives us two equations:

1) F = S + 2
2) S = C + 1

We also know that the proportion of flour to sugar to cocoa powder should remain constant. The original recipe calls for 11 cups of flour, 7 cups of sugar, and 5 cups of cocoa powder. This gives us a ratio of 11:7:5 for flour to sugar to cocoa powder.

Since the proportion must remain constant, the ratio of the amounts Mary has already put in must also be 11:7:5. This gives us another equation:

3) F:S:C = 11:7:5

Now, we can use equations 1 and 2 to express F and S in terms of C:

From equation 2, we have S = C + 1. Substituting S from equation 1, we get:

F = (C + 1) + 2
F = C + 3

Now we have F and S in terms of C:

F = C + 3
S = C + 1

We can now express the ratio F:S:C in terms of C:

(C + 3):(C + 1):C

To find the actual values, we need to find a common multiple of 11, 7, and 5 that fits the form of (C + 3):(C + 1):C. However, since we are only asked for the number of cups of flour Mary put in, we can simply use the ratio to find F in terms of C.

From the ratio 11:7:5, we can write:

F/11 = S/7 = C/5

Using the relationship between F and C (F = C + 3), we can write:

(C + 3)/11 = C/5

Now we can solve for C:

5(C + 3) = 11C
5C + 15 = 11C
15 = 11C - 5C
15 = 6C
C = 15/6
C = 2.5

Now that we have the value of C, we can find F:

F = C + 3
F = 2.5 + 3
F = 5.5

However, since we cannot have half a cup, we need to find the smallest whole number that fits the ratio. The smallest whole number that fits the ratio for C (which is 5 times the actual amount) is 5, so we multiply 2.5 by 2 to get the whole number for C:

C = 2.5 * 2
C = 5

Now we can find F:

F = 5 + 3
F = 8

Mary has put in 8 cups of flour.","Mary has already added 6 cups of flour to the bowl.

We know that the ratio remains constant, and Mary still needs 2 cups more of flour than sugar, and 1 cup more sugar than cocoa powder. We can use this information to set up a system of equations:

F = flour, S = Sugar, C = Cocoa Powder

2F + S = 11
S + C = 7

2F + 6 = 11, so F = 2

S + 5 = 7, so S = 2

Going back to our equation for flour, we can now see that F = 2 cups.

Therefore, the final result is 2.","Let's denote the number of cups of flour Mary put in as F, the number of cups of sugar as S, and the number of cups of cocoa powder as C.

According to the information given, Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar and 1 more cup of sugar than cocoa powder. This can be written as:

F = S + 2
S = C + 1

We also know that the proportion of flour to sugar to cocoa powder should always remain constant. This means that the ratio of F:S:C is constant. We can express this as:

F / S = S / C

Substituting the expressions for F and S from the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

(F / S) = (S / C)
(F / (S + 2)) = (S / (C + 1))

Now, let's solve for F:

F = (S + 2) * (S / (C + 1))
F = S * (S / (C + 1)) + 2 * (S / (C + 1))
F = S * (S / (C + 1)) + 2 * (S / (C + 1))
F = S * (S + 2) / (C + 1)

We don't have the values for S and C, so we can't solve for F directly. However, we can express F in terms of S and C, which is what we wanted to do.",2,S * (S + 2) / (C + 1),eight

(2/5) * 149 = 298/5 = 59.6
Since you can't have a fraction of a cake, we'll round down to 59 cakes sold.

The number of cakes Baker still has is:
149 - 59 = 90 cakes

Baker still has 90 cakes.","Baker initially had 149 cakes. 2/5 of this amount is 59.6, which we will round down to 59.

He had 91 pastries, and 3/4 of them are 68.25, which we will round down to 68.

So Baker still has 90 cakes left.

**90**","First, let's calculate how many cakes Baker sold:

Baker sold 2/5 of the cakes, so he sold:
2/5 * 149 = 59.6 cakes

Since we can't sell a fraction of a cake, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. Since 59.6 is closer to 60 than to 59, we'll round up to 60 cakes sold.

Now, let's calculate how many pastries Baker sold:

Baker sold 3/4 of the pastries, so he sold:
3/4 * 91 = 68.25 pastries

Again, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 68 pastries sold.

Now, let's find out how many cakes Baker still has:

Baker started with 149 cakes, and he sold 60 cakes, so he still has:
149 - 60 = 89 cakes left.

Therefore, Baker still has 89 cakes.",90,89,90
334,"In Lawrence county, there are 898,051 kids. During summer break, 74.5% of the kids go to camp and the rest stay home. How many kids stay home?","To find out how many kids stay home, we first need to calculate the number of kids who go to camp. We do this by multiplying the total number of kids by the percentage that goes to camp:

898,051 kids * 74.5% = 898,051 kids * 0.745 = 669,348.045 kids

Since we can't have a fraction of a kid, we'll round this number to the nearest whole number. So, approximately 669,348 kids go to camp.

Now, to find out how many kids stay home, we subtract the number of kids who go to camp from the total number of kids:

898,051 kids - 669,348 kids = 228,703 kids

So, approximately 228,703 kids stay home during summer break.","We know that 74.5% of kids go to camp, which means 100% - 74.5% = 25.5% stay home. 

Therefore, 25.5% of 898,051 kids stay home. This equates to 228,493 kids.

335,"Let x be the number of baskets and y be the number of peaches per basket, with z being the number of green peaches per basket. If you randomly pick a peach from the baskets, find the probability of it being a green peach.","To find the probability of picking a green peach, we need to know the total number of peaches and the total number of green peaches.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of baskets,
- \( y \) as the number of peaches per basket,
- \( z \) as the number of green peaches per basket.

The total number of peaches is the product of the number of baskets and the number of peaches per basket, which is \( x \times y \).

The total number of green peaches is the product of the number of baskets and the number of green peaches per basket, which is \( x \times z \).

The probability \( P \) of picking a green peach is the ratio of the total number of green peaches to the total number of peaches:

\[ P = \frac{\text{Total number of green peaches}}{\text{Total number of peaches}} \]

\[ P = \frac{x \times z}{x \times y} \]

Since \( x \) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, it cancels out:

\[ P = \frac{z}{y} \]

So the probability of picking a green peach is the ratio of the number of green peaches per basket to the total number of peaches per basket.","We are trying to find the probability of picking a green peach from a random basket. Let's first break down what we know:
x = number of baskets
y = number of peaches in a basket, and 
z = number of green peaches in a basket. 

We want to find the probability P(z), which will be the ratio of green peaches to the total number of peaches. 

The probability of picking a green peach would therefore be: 
P(z) = z / (x * y)

The answer is 1/y. 

Green.","Let's denote the probability of picking a green peach as P.

Since we are picking one peach at random from all the baskets, we need to consider the total number of peaches in all the baskets. This total number of peaches is given by the product of the number of baskets (x) and the number of peaches per basket (y).

The number of green peaches per basket is z, so the total number of green peaches in all the baskets is given by the product of the number of baskets (x) and the number of green peaches per basket (z).

The probability P of picking a green peach is the ratio of the total number of green peaches to the total number of peaches:

P = (Total number of green peaches) / (Total number of peaches)
P = (x * z) / (x * y)
P = z / y

On weekends, there is an increase of 15% in visitors, while on weekdays the numbers remain relatively constant. This year, there were 20 public holidays when the number of visitors doubled. There were also 4 special events which happened this year, each lasted 4 days with an average increase of 40% in the visitor count on each of these days. When Rachel went, it was a normal weekday. How many more or less visitors visited the Buckingham palace the day Rachel went than the total visitors over the last 365 days?","First, let's calculate the average number of visitors on a typical day, a weekend, a public holiday, and during special events.

Typical day visitors: 705

Weekend increase: 15% of 705
Weekend visitors: 705 + (0.15 * 705) = 705 + 105.75 = 810.75

Public holidays visitors (doubled): 705 * 2 = 1410

Special events increase: 40% of 705
Special events visitors: 705 + (0.40 * 705) = 705 + 282 = 987

Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors for each type of day over the year.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so there are 52 weekends. Since each weekend has 2 days, there are 104 weekend days.

Weekend visitors over the year: 810.75 * 104 = 84318

There are 20 public holidays.

Public holidays visitors over the year: 1410 * 20 = 28200

There are 4 special events, each lasting 4 days.

Special events days: 4 * 4 = 16
Special events visitors over the year: 987 * 16 = 15792

Now, let's calculate the number of normal weekdays. There are 365 days in a year, and we have already accounted for weekend days, public holidays, and special event days.

Normal weekdays: 365 - (104 + 20 + 16) = 365 - 140 = 225

Normal weekday visitors over the year: 705 * 225 = 158625

Now, let's sum up all the visitors over the year.

Total visitors over the year: 84318 (weekend) + 28200 (public holidays) + 15792 (special events) + 158625 (normal weekdays) = 84318 + 28200 + 15792 + 158625 = 289935

Since Rachel went on a normal weekday, the number of visitors was 705.

The difference between the total visitors over the last 365 days and the visitors on the day Rachel went is:

Total visitors over the year - Visitors on the day Rachel went = 289935 - 705 = 289230

So, there were 289230 more visitors over the last 365 days than the number of visitors on the day Rachel went to the Buckingham Palace.","Let's break down the information given:

- On a typical day, 705 visitors come to the Buckingham Palace.

- On weekends, there's a 15% increase in visitors. 15% of 705 is 105.85, so we can round this up to 106 extra visitors on weekends.

- On weekdays, the numbers remain constant, so no increase there.

- This year, there were 20 days with double the number of visitors (public holidays). 2 x 705 = 1410 visitors.

- There were 4 special 4-day events with an average 40% increase in visitors. 40% of 705 is 282, so the increase per day is about 70 extra visitors. Multiplied by 4 days, the special event days saw 282 x 4 = 1128 extra visitors.

Now, considering it was a normal weekday when Rachel visited, the number of visitors would be the standard 705.

Therefore, over the last 365 days, the total number of visitors would be: 
705 typical daily visitors x 365 = 257475

This means that the number of visitors the day Rachel went was 257475 - 705 = 256770 fewer than the total annual visitors.

Few.","Let's break down the information given:

1. On a typical day, 705 visitors come to the Buckingham Palace.
2. On weekends, there is an increase of 15% in visitors. So, the number of visitors on weekends is 705 * 1.15 = 810.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we'll round this to 811 visitors on weekends.
3. On weekdays, the numbers remain relatively constant, so we'll assume they stay at 705 visitors.
4. There were 20 public holidays when the number of visitors doubled. So, on these days, there were 705 * 2 = 1410 visitors.
5. There were 4 special events, each lasting 4 days, with an average increase of 40% in the visitor count on each of these days. Since the increase is 40%, we'll assume the increase is 40% of the typical day's visitors. So, the increase on each of these days is 705 * 0.40 = 282 visitors. Since each event lasts 4 days, the total increase for each event is 282 * 4 = 1128 visitors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors over the last 365 days:

- There are 52 weeks in a year, so there are 52 * 7 = 364 weekdays.
- There are 52 weeks in a year, so there are 52 * 2 = 104 weekend days.
- There are 20 public holidays, so there are 20 * 4 = 80 special event days.

Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors for each type of day:

- Weekday visitors: 364 * 705 = 255970
- Weekend visitors: 104 * 811 = 84944
- Public holiday visitors: 80 * 1410 = 112800
- Special event visitors: 80 * 1128 = 90240

Now, let's add up all the visitors:

Total visitors = 255970 (weekday visitors) + 84944 (weekend visitors) + 112800 (public holiday visitors) + 90240 (special event visitors)

341,"There were 17 roses in the vase initially. Jessica threw away 8 roses from the vase, and then she cut some more roses from her flower garden. She added one-third of the freshly cut roses to the vase, and now there are 42 roses in the vase. Moreover, she also gave away 6 roses from the total fresh cut roses to her neighbor. How many roses did she cut from her garden?","Let's denote the number of freshly cut roses from the garden as \( x \).

After Jessica threw away 8 roses from the initial 17 in the vase, there were \( 17 - 8 = 9 \) roses left in the vase.

She then added one-third of the freshly cut roses to the vase, so \( \frac{1}{3}x \) were added to the vase.

Now, there are 42 roses in the vase, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 9 + \frac{1}{3}x = 42 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 42 - 9 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 33 \]

Now, we multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 33 \times 3 \]
\[ x = 99 \]

Jessica cut 99 roses from her garden.

However, we also know that she gave away 6 roses to her neighbor. This means that the total number of freshly cut roses is the sum of the roses added to the vase and the roses given away:

\[ \frac{1}{3}x + 6 = 42 + 6 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 99 + 6 = 48 \]

This confirms that the total number of freshly cut roses is indeed 99.","There were 17 + 8 = 25 roses left in the vase after Jessica threw away 8 roses. 
She added 25 / 3 = 8.33... roses to the vase (we'll take the floor since roses are whole numbers).
So after adding the freshly cut roses, there were 25 + 8 = 33 roses in the vase.
Jessica cut 33 + 6 = 39 roses from her garden.

**39**","Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden as \( x \).

According to the information given, Jessica started with 17 roses in the vase. She threw away 8 roses, so the number of roses left in the vase was \( 17 - 8 = 9 \).

Then, she cut \( x \) roses from her garden. She added one-third of these freshly cut roses to the vase, so the number of roses added is \( \frac{1}{3}x \).

After adding these roses, the total number of roses in the vase became \( 9 + \frac{1}{3}x \).

We are told that after adding these roses, there were 42 roses in the vase. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ 9 + \frac{1}{3}x = 42 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 42 - 9 \]

342,"Rachel had 20 pages of math homework to complete. She also had reading homework, which was 30% less than the number of pages for her math homework. Moreover, she also had an assignment for science which was twice the number of pages of her reading homework. How many pages of homework did she have to complete in total?","First, let's calculate the number of pages Rachel had for her reading homework. Since it was 30% less than her math homework, we subtract 30% of 20 pages from 20 pages.

30% of 20 pages is (30/100) * 20 = 6 pages.

So, her reading homework was 20 pages - 6 pages = 14 pages.

Next, let's calculate the number of pages for her science homework. Since it was twice the number of pages of her reading homework, we multiply the number of pages of her reading homework by 2.

Science homework pages = 14 pages * 2 = 28 pages.

Now, let's add up all the pages of homework she had to complete:

Math homework pages = 20 pages
Reading homework pages = 14 pages
Science homework pages = 28 pages

Total pages of homework = 20 + 14 + 28 = 62 pages.

Rachel had to complete 62 pages of homework in total.","Rachel had 20 pages of math homework. Her reading homework was 30% less than the math homework, so she had 20 * 0.7 = 14 pages. 
Her science assignment was twice the amount of her reading homework, so it was 14 * 2 = 28 pages. 
So in total, Rachel had to complete 20 + 14 + 28 = 62 pages of homework. 

Sixty-two.","Rachel had 20 pages of math homework. Her reading homework was 30% less than the number of pages for her math homework, so we calculate 30% of 20:

Now, we subtract the 6 pages of reading homework from the 20 pages of math homework to find out how many pages of math homework she had left:

20 pages (math homework) - 6 pages (reading homework) = 14 pages (math homework left)

Rachel's science assignment was twice the number of pages of her reading homework, so we calculate 2 times the number of pages of her reading homework:

2 * 6 pages (reading homework) = 12 pages (science homework)

343,"In a summer camp, there are 52 campers who went rowing in twenty 2-person row boats during the morning. In the afternoon, additional campers arrived and 61 campers went out rowing. The number of rowboats increased to twenty-five but this time, some boats carried 2 campers while the others carried 3. How many boats carried 3 campers in the afternoon?","Let's start by figuring out how many campers were in each boat in the morning. Since there were 20 boats and each boat carried 2 campers, we can calculate the total number of campers in the morning as:

20 boats * 2 campers/boat = 40 campers

However, the problem states that there were 52 campers who went rowing in the morning. This means that my initial assumption was incorrect, and there must have been some boats carrying more than 2 campers or there were more boats than initially stated. Since the problem specifically says there were twenty 2-person row boats, it seems there might be an inconsistency in the problem as presented.

Assuming the problem meant to say there were 26 boats in the morning (which would accommodate 52 campers at 2 per boat), we can proceed to the afternoon scenario.

In the afternoon, there are 61 campers and 25 boats. Some of these boats carry 2 campers, and others carry 3. Let's use x to represent the number of boats carrying 3 campers and (25 - x) to represent the number of boats carrying 2 campers. We can set up the following equation:

3x + 2(25 - x) = 61

Solving for x gives us the number of boats carrying 3 campers:

3x + 50 - 2x = 61
x = 61 - 50
x = 11

So, 11 boats carried 3 campers in the afternoon.","We know that 61 campers went rowing in the afternoon, and that the number of boats increased to twenty-five. If we assume that all the boats were fully occupied, we can calculate the number of boats carrying three campers as follows: 

1. Find the total number of campers that fit into two-person boats: 52 campers in the morning, plus twice the number of two-person boats which is 2 x 20 = 40 campers. 

2. The remaining campers must have been in the three-person boats: 61 - 40 = 21 campers. 

3. Divide the remaining campers by three, as each three-person boat carries three campers: 21 / 3 = 7 boats. 

Therefore, **seven** boats carried three campers in the afternoon.","In the morning, there were 52 campers and 20 boats, so each boat carried 2 campers.

In the afternoon, there were 61 campers and 25 boats, so each boat carried 2.44 campers. Since we can't have a fraction of a camper, we need to find out how many boats carried 3 campers and how many carried 2 campers.

First, let's find out how many campers were in boats that carried 2 campers. Since there were 25 boats and each of these boats carried 2 campers, we have:

25 boats * 2 campers/boat = 50 campers

Now, let's find out how many campers were in boats that carried 3 campers. Since there were 61 campers in total and 50 campers were in 2-camper boats, we have:

61 campers - 50 campers = 11 campers

Now, we need to find out how many 3-camper boats there were. Since there were 11 campers in 3-camper boats and each of these boats carried 3 campers, we have:

11 campers / 3 campers/boat = 3.67 boats

Since we can't have a fraction of a boat, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there were 3 boats that carried 3 campers in the afternoon.",seven,3,11

There are 80 campers at a summer camp participating in different activities during the morning and afternoon sessions. In the morning, 41 campers went rowing, 4 campers went hiking, and 15 campers went swimming. In the afternoon, 26 campers went rowing, 8 campers went hiking, and the remaining campers went swimming. How many campers went rowing and hiking in total, considering both the morning and afternoon sessions?","To find the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in both the morning and afternoon sessions, we need to add the number of campers who went rowing in the morning to the number who went rowing in the afternoon, and do the same for hiking.

Morning rowing: 41 campers
Afternoon rowing: 26 campers
Total rowing: 41 + 26 = 67 campers

Morning hiking: 4 campers
Afternoon hiking: 8 campers
Total hiking: 4 + 8 = 12 campers

Now, we add the total number of campers who went rowing to the total number of campers who went hiking:

Total rowing and hiking: 67 (rowing) + 12 (hiking) = 79 campers

So, 79 campers went rowing and hiking in total, considering both the morning and afternoon sessions.","We know that in the morning:
- 41 campers went rowing
- 4 campers went hiking

And in the afternoon:
- 26 campers went rowing
- 8 campers went hiking

To find the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking, we add the corresponding numbers together:
Rowing: 41 (morning) + 26 (afternoon) = 67
Hiking: 4 (morning) + 8 (afternoon) = 12

Therefore, the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking is 67 + 12 = 79. 

The final result is 79.","In the morning, 41 campers went rowing, 4 campers went hiking, and 15 campers went swimming. This means that 41 + 4 + 15 = 60 campers were involved in these activities.

In the afternoon, 26 campers went rowing, 8 campers went hiking, and the remaining campers went swimming. To find out how many campers went swimming in the afternoon, we first need to know the total number of campers in the afternoon. Since there are 80 campers in total, and we know that 60 campers were involved in the morning activities, the remaining number of campers in the afternoon is 80 - 60 = 20 campers.

Now, we can find out how many campers went swimming in the afternoon by subtracting the number of campers who went hiking from the remaining campers: 20 - 8 = 12 campers went swimming in the afternoon.

Finally, to find out the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking, we add the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in both the morning and afternoon sessions: 41 (rowing in the morning) + 4 (hiking in the morning) + 26 (rowing in the afternoon) + 8 (hiking in the afternoon) = 80 campers.

He ate 18 cookies, so he had 25 - 18 = 7 cookies left.

He then gave 21 cookies to his friend, but since he only had 7 cookies left after eating 18, it's not possible for him to give away 21 cookies. There seems to be a mistake in the information provided.

However, if we ignore this discrepancy and assume he somehow managed to give 21 cookies to his friend, he would have 7 - 21 = -14 cookies (which is not possible in reality as you can't have negative cookies).

Since Tiffany didn't collect any cans on Sunday, she ended the week with 7.5 bags of cans.","Let's solve this together!

We start with 4 bags on Monday.
On Tuesday, we add 2.5 bags, so we have 4 + 2.5 = 6.5 bags.
On Wednesday, we subtract 1.25 bags, leaving us with 6.5 - 1.25 = 5.25 bags.
Thursday sees no additions or subtractions, so we stay at 5.25 bags.
On Friday, we gain 3.75 bags, bringing us to 9 bags.
Unfortunately, on Saturday, 1.5 bags are accidentally discarded, so we're back down to 9 - 1.5 = 7.5 bags.

347,"The grasshopper, the frog, the mouse, the kangaroo, and the rabbit had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 36 inches. The frog jumped 17 inches farther than the grasshopper. The mouse jumped 15 inches farther than the frog. The kangaroo jumped twice the distance of the mouse, while the rabbit jumped 12 inches less than half the distance of the kangaroo. How far did each animal jump?","Let's calculate the jumping distance for each animal step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 36 inches.

2. The frog jumped 17 inches farther than the grasshopper, so:
   Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 17 inches
   Frog's jump = 36 inches + 17 inches
   Frog's jump = 53 inches

3. The mouse jumped 15 inches farther than the frog, so:
   Mouse's jump = Frog's jump + 15 inches
   Mouse's jump = 53 inches + 15 inches
   Mouse's jump = 68 inches

4. The kangaroo jumped twice the distance of the mouse, so:
   Kangaroo's jump = 2 × Mouse's jump
   Kangaroo's jump = 2 × 68 inches
   Kangaroo's jump = 136 inches

5. The rabbit jumped 12 inches less than half the distance of the kangaroo, so first we find half the kangaroo's jump:
   Half of Kangaroo's jump = Kangaroo's jump / 2
   Half of Kangaroo's jump = 136 inches / 2
   Half of Kangaroo's jump = 68 inches
   Now, we subtract 12 inches from half the kangaroo's jump to find the rabbit's jump:
   Rabbit's jump = Half of Kangaroo's jump - 12 inches
   Rabbit's jump = 68 inches - 12 inches
   Rabbit's jump = 56 inches

So, the jumping distances for each animal are:
- Grasshopper: 36 inches
- Frog: 53 inches
- Mouse: 68 inches
- Kangaroo: 136 inches
- Rabbit: 56 inches","We start with the grasshopper's jump of 36 inches. 

The frog jumps 17 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we add 17 inches to the grasshopper's 36, giving the frog a total of 53 inches. 

The mouse jumps 15 inches farther than the frog, so we add another 15 to the frog's 53, resulting in the mouse's jump of 68 inches. 

The kangaroo doubles the mouse's jump, jumping twice as far, which equates to 136 inches. 

Finally, the rabbit jumps half as far as the kangaroo, minus 12 inches, which gives us 62 inches. 

The results are as follows:
Grasshopper: 36 inches
Frog: 53 inches
Mouse: 68 inches
Kangaroo: 136 inches
Rabbit: 62 inches.

**62 inches**","Let's denote the grasshopper's jump as G inches.

According to the information given, the frog jumped 17 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog's jump is G + 17 inches.

The mouse jumped 15 inches farther than the frog, so the mouse's jump is (G + 17) + 15 inches.

The kangaroo jumped twice the distance of the mouse, so the kangaroo's jump is 2 * ((G + 17) + 15) inches.

The rabbit jumped 12 inches less than half the distance of the kangaroo, so the rabbit's jump is (1/2 * (2 * ((G + 17) + 15)) - 12 inches.

Now, let's plug in the grasshopper's jump of 36 inches to find the jumps of the other animals:

The frog jumped 36 + 17 = 53 inches.

The mouse jumped 53 + 15 = 68 inches.

The kangaroo jumped 2 * (68) = 136 inches.

The rabbit jumped (1/2 * (2 * (68)) - 12 = (1/2 * (136) - 12 = 68 - 12 = 56 inches.

So, the grasshopper jumped 36 inches, the frog jumped 53 inches, the mouse jumped 68 inches, the kangaroo jumped 136 inches, and the rabbit jumped 56 inches.",62,56,56

He sold some cakes on the first day and the rest on the next day. If by the end of the second day he only has left 13 cakes from the first batch and 10% of the second batch, how many cakes did he sell in total?","First, let's find out how many cakes Baker made in the second batch. Since he made 2/3 of the amount of the first batch, we calculate:

Second batch = 2/3 * 54 cakes from the first batch
Second batch = 36 cakes

Now, let's find out how many cakes he has left from the second batch. Since he has 10% of the second batch left, we calculate:

Left from second batch = 10% of 36 cakes
Left from second batch = 0.10 * 36
Left from second batch = 3.6 cakes

Since we can't have a fraction of a cake in this context, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3 cakes left from the second batch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cakes he sold. We'll add the cakes sold from the first batch and the second batch:

Cakes sold from the first batch = 54 cakes (initial) - 13 cakes (left)
Cakes sold from the first batch = 41 cakes

Cakes sold from the second batch = 36 cakes (initial) - 3 cakes (left)
Cakes sold from the second batch = 33 cakes

Total cakes sold = Cakes sold from the first batch + Cakes sold from the second batch
Total cakes sold = 41 cakes + 33 cakes

Baker sold a total of 74 cakes.","Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The first batch has 54 cakes, and the second batch has 2/3 * 54 = 36 cakes.

2. We know that after the two days, there are 13 cakes from the first batch and 36 * 0.1 = 3.6 cakes (we can round up to 4) from the second left unsold.

3. We can now calculate that the total number of cakes sold is 54 - 13 = 41 from the first batch. For the second batch, it's 36 - 4 = 32.

From the second batch, he only made 2/3 of the amount he did for the first. So, he made 2/3 * 54 = 36 cakes for the second batch.

He sold 10% of the second batch, which is 10% * 36 = 3.6 cakes (since we can't sell a fraction of a cake, we'll round this to 4 cakes).

351,"Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, while Tim had 10 marbles less than Doug. Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground. After losing some marbles, Ed gave 4 marbles to Tim, and Doug gave 3 marbles to Tim. Now, Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug and Tim has the same number of marbles as Doug. How many marbles did Ed lose?","Let's denote the number of marbles Doug has as D. According to the problem, Ed initially had D + 19 marbles, and Tim had D - 10 marbles.

After Ed lost some marbles and gave 4 to Tim, and Doug gave 3 to Tim, the new situation is as follows:
- Ed has (D + 19 - L - 4) marbles, where L is the number of marbles Ed lost.
- Tim has (D - 10 + 4 + 3) marbles.
- Doug still has D marbles, since we are not told that he lost any.

We are told that after these transactions, Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug, and Tim has the same number of marbles as Doug. This gives us two equations:

1) D + 19 - L - 4 = D + 8
2) D - 10 + 4 + 3 = D

Let's solve the second equation first to find the value of D:

D - 10 + 4 + 3 = D
D - 3 = D
This equation simplifies to 0 = 3, which is not possible. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement or in the interpretation of the transactions. 

However, we can still use the information that Tim has the same number of marbles as Doug after the transactions to correct the second equation:

D - 10 + 4 + 3 = D
D - 3 = D
D - D = 3
0 = 3

This is still not possible, indicating an error in the problem. Let's assume that the correct statement is that Tim ends up with the same number of marbles as Doug after receiving marbles from both Ed and Doug. This would give us the equation:

D - 10 + 4 + 3 = D
D - 3 = D
D - D = 3
0 = 3

This is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and the equations we've set up.

We know that Tim ends up with the same number of marbles as Doug, so the correct equation should be:

D - 10 + 4 + 3 = D
D - 3 = D

Now, let's solve the first equation with the correct understanding that Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug after losing some and giving 4 to Tim:

D + 19 - L - 4 = D + 8
D + 15 - L = D + 8
15 - L = 8
L = 15 - 8
L = 7

So, Ed lost 7 marbles.","Let's solve the marble mystery!

First, we need to understand the initial situation, which is that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, and Doug has 10 more marbles than Tim. So, we can deduce that Ed has 29 marbles, Doug has 19, and Tim has 9.

Next, we learn that Ed lost some of his marbles and then gave 4 away to Tim. Let's say Ed lost x marbles. After this, Ed would have 29 - x - 4 = 25 - x marbles.

It's also mentioned that Doug gave 3 marbles to Tim, so after this generous act, Tim's marble count increased to 9 + 3 = 12 marbles.

Since Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug, we can set up the equation: 25 - x - 4 = 19 + 12. Solving for x, we find that Ed lost 5 marbles!

So, the final result is: 5.","Let's denote the number of marbles Doug has as D. According to the information given, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had D + 19 marbles. Tim had 10 marbles less than Doug, so Tim had D - 10 marbles.

After losing some marbles, Ed gave 4 marbles to Tim, and Doug gave 3 marbles to Tim. This means that after giving marbles to Tim, Ed had D + 19 - 4 = D + 15 marbles, and Doug had D + 3 marbles.

Now, we know that after giving marbles to Tim, Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug, so we can write the equation:

D + 15 = D + 3 + 8

To solve for the number of marbles Ed lost, we need to find out how many marbles Ed had before losing any. We can do this by adding the number of marbles Doug has to the number of marbles Ed had after giving some to Tim:

D + (D + 15) = D + 3 + 8 + D

Combining like terms, we get:

2D + 15 = D + 3 + 8 + D

Now, let's distribute the D's:

2D + 15 = D + 3 + 8 + 2D

Combining the terms with D, we get:

3D + 15 = D + 3 + 8

Subtract D from both sides:

3D + 15 - D = D + 3 + 8 - D

Now, let's combine the terms with D:

3D + 15 - D = 3D + 3 + 8

Subtract 3D from both sides:

3D + 15 - D = 3D + 3 + 8 - 3D

Now, let's combine the terms with D:

3D + 15 - D = 3D + 3 + 8

Subtract 3D from both sides:

3D + 15 - D = 3D + 3 + 8 - 3D

Now, let's combine the terms with D:

3D + 15 - D = 3D + 3 + 8

Subtract 3D from both sides:

3D + 15 - D = 3D + 3 + 8 - 3D

Now, let's combine the terms with D:

3D + 15 - D = 3D + 3 + 8

Subtract 3D from both sides:

6 pencils/pack * 55 packs = 330 pencils

Now, Faye is placing these pencils into rows with 4 pencils in each row. To find out how many rows she can make, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row:

330 pencils ÷ 4 pencils/row = 82.5 rows

How many people were present in the program in total?","First, let's calculate the number of accompanying family members for the pupils. Since for every 6 pupils there were 2 family members, we can find the total number of family members by dividing the number of pupils by 6 and then multiplying by 2.

Number of family members = (Number of pupils / 6) * 2
Number of family members = (956 / 6) * 2
Number of family members = 159.333 * 2
Since the number of family members must be a whole number, we'll round down to 159 (since you can't have a fraction of a person).

Now, let's add up all the people present at the program:

Number of parents = 83
Number of pupils = 956
Number of teachers = 154
Number of staff members = 27
Number of family members = 159

Total number of people present = Number of parents + Number of pupils + Number of teachers + Number of staff members + Number of family members
Total number of people present = 83 + 956 + 154 + 27 + 159
Total number of people present = 1379

Therefore, there were 1379 people present at the program in total.","There were 83 + 956 + 154 + 27 = 1120 people present at the program. 

If we add the accompanying family members, then for every 6 pupils, we add 2 people, so we add 956 / 6 * 2 = 318 family members. 

Adding these together, the total number of people present is 1120 + 318 = 1438.

**1,438**","First, let's calculate the number of accompanying family members. Since there were 956 pupils and for every 6 pupils, there were 2 accompanying family members, we can calculate the number of family members as follows:

He picked 134 tomatoes yesterday and 30 tomatoes today, so the total number of tomatoes picked is:

134 (yesterday) + 30 (today) = 164 tomatoes

Now, let's find out how many tomatoes are remaining:

171 (initial) - 164 (picked) = 7 tomatoes remaining

The farmer also started with 225 cucumbers and picked 157 cucumbers during the same period. So, the number of cucumbers remaining is:

225 (initial) - 157 (picked) = 68 cucumbers remaining

Now, to find the ratio of remaining tomatoes to remaining cucumbers, we divide the number of remaining tomatoes by the number of remaining cucumbers:

7 tomatoes : 68 cucumbers

This ratio can be simplified by dividing both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which in this case is 1 (since 7 is a prime number and does not divide evenly into 68). So the simplified ratio of remaining tomatoes to remaining cucumbers is:

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a candy in a bag, this suggests that the candies are not evenly distributed among the bags. This means we need to find a number that both 150 and 220 can be divided by to give us a whole number when divided by 25 bags. Since we know 150 is divisible by 25, we need to find a number that 220 is also divisible by that will give us a whole number when divided by 25.

The number that satisfies this condition is 200 (as 200 candies would give us 8 candies per bag). This means we have 20 extra candies that are not being considered if we are to have an equal number of candies in each bag.

Now, let's look at the chocolate bars. We have 50 chocolate bars and 25 bags, so:

50 chocolate bars / 25 bags = 2 chocolate bars per bag

So, each of the 25 bags contains 6 cookies, 8 candies (if we consider 200 candies to be evenly distributed), and 2 chocolate bars. The remaining 20 candies can be distributed in some other way, but they are not part of the evenly distributed bags.

In conclusion, you have 25 bags of cookies, candies, and chocolate bars, with each bag containing 6 cookies, 8 candies, and 2 chocolate bars. The 20 extra candies will need to be distributed separately or not included in the bags.","Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that the number of cookies and candies in total is 150 + 220 = 370.
This means that each bag contains 370 / 25 = 15 pieces of cookies and candies.

Next, we sum the number of chocolate bars: 50 / 25 = 2 per bag.

So each bag has a total of 15 + 2 = 17 items.

The final result is 25 bags.","Let's denote the number of bags as B.

We know that each bag contains the same number of cookies, candies, and chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of cookies, candies, and chocolate bars in each bag is the total number of each item divided by the number of bags.

For cookies:
Total number of cookies = 150
Number of cookies in each bag = Total number of cookies / Number of bags
Number of cookies in each bag = 150 / B

For candies:
Total number of candies = 220
Number of candies in each bag = Total number of candies / Number of bags
Number of candies in each bag = 220 / B

For chocolate bars:
Total number of chocolate bars = 50
Number of chocolate bars in each bag = Total number of chocolate bars / Number of bags
Number of chocolate bars in each bag = 50 / B

Now, let's find the common number of items in each bag:

Common number of items in each bag = Number of cookies in each bag = Number of candies in each bag = Number of chocolate bars in each bag
Common number of items in each bag = (150 / B) = (220 / B) = (50 / B)

To find the common number of items in each bag, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers 150, 220, and 50.

The GCD of 150 and 220 is 110. The GCD of 110 and 50 is 50. Therefore, the GCD of 150, 220, and 50 is 50.

Now, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total number of each item by the common number of items in each bag:

Number of bags = Total number of cookies / Common number of items in each bag
Number of bags = 150 / 50
Number of bags = 3

So, you have 3 bags of cookies, candies, and chocolate bars.",Twenty five.,3,25
363,"During the orange harvest season, a farmer collected oranges in sacks. For the first 30 days, he harvested 66 sacks per day, each containing 25 oranges. For the next 27 days, due to better weather conditions, he managed to harvest 10 more sacks each day, and due to the size of the oranges, each of these sacks contained 30 oranges. Unfortunately, in the last 30 days, due to a sudden pest infestation, he could only harvest half the amount of sacks he got in the first 30 days, and each sack only contained 20 oranges. How many oranges did the farmer harvest in total over these 87 days?","Let's calculate the total number of oranges harvested in each of the three periods:

First 30 days:
Number of sacks per day = 66
Number of oranges per sack = 25
Total oranges in 30 days = 30 days * 66 sacks/day * 25 oranges/sack

Next 27 days:
Number of sacks per day = 66 + 10 = 76
Number of oranges per sack = 30
Total oranges in 27 days = 27 days * 76 sacks/day * 30 oranges/sack

Last 30 days:
Number of sacks per day = 66 / 2 = 33 (half the amount of the first 30 days)
Number of oranges per sack = 20
Total oranges in 30 days = 30 days * 33 sacks/day * 20 oranges/sack

Now, let's calculate the totals for each period:

First 30 days total oranges = 30 * 66 * 25
Next 27 days total oranges = 27 * 76 * 30
Last 30 days total oranges = 30 * 33 * 20

Finally, we add up all the oranges from the three periods to get the total harvest:

Total harvest = (30 * 66 * 25) + (27 * 76 * 30) + (30 * 33 * 20)

Let's do the math:

First 30 days total oranges = 30 * 66 * 25 = 49500
Next 27 days total oranges = 27 * 76 * 30 = 61560
Last 30 days total oranges = 30 * 33 * 20 = 19800

Total harvest = 49500 + 61560 + 19800 = 130860

The farmer harvested a total of 130,860 oranges over the 87 days.","Let's calculate the total number of oranges the farmer harvested over the 87 days:
1. For the first 30 days:
- Number of sacks = 66 sacks/day × 30 days = 1980 sacks
- Total oranges = 1980 sacks × 25 oranges/sack = 49,500 oranges

2. For the next 27 days:
- Number of sacks = 76 sacks/day × 27 days = 2,052 sacks
- Total oranges = 2,052 sacks × 30 oranges/sack = 61,560 oranges

3. For the last 30 days:
- Number of sacks = 1980 sacks / 2 = 990 sacks
- Total oranges = 990 sacks × 20 oranges/sack = 19,800 oranges

4. Now, adding the total oranges from the three periods:
- 49,500 oranges + 61,560 oranges + 19,800 oranges = 120,860 oranges

The farmer harvested a total of **120,860** oranges over the 87 days.","First, let's calculate the total number of oranges the farmer harvested in the first 30 days:

For the first 30 days, he harvested 66 sacks per day, each containing 25 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
66 sacks/day * 25 oranges/sack * 30 days = 51900 oranges

Next, let's calculate the total number of oranges the farmer harvested in the next 27 days:

For the next 27 days, he harvested 10 more sacks each day, and each of these sacks contained 30 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
(66 + 10) sacks/day * 30 oranges/sack * 27 days = 100000 oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of oranges the farmer harvested in the last 30 days:

In the last 30 days, he could only harvest half the amount of sacks he got in the first 30 days, and each sack only contained 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
(66 / 2) sacks/day * 20 oranges/sack * 30 days = 19800 oranges

Finally, let's add up all the oranges the farmer harvested over the 87 days:

Total oranges = 51900 (from the first 30 days) + 100000 (from the next 27 days) + 19800 (from the last 30 days)
Total oranges = 51900 + 100000 + 19800

In the first neighbourhood, there are 15 blocks and 12 houses in each block where he needs to deliver two pieces of junk mail to each house. In the second neighbourhood, there are 20 blocks and 18 houses in each block where he needs to deliver three pieces of junk mail to each house. Meanwhile, in the third neighbourhood, there are 10 blocks with 15 houses in each block where he has to deliver four pieces of junk mail to each house. How many pieces of junk mail should he deliver in total?","To find the total number of pieces of junk mail the mailman needs to deliver, we need to calculate the number of pieces for each neighbourhood and then sum them up.

For the first neighbourhood:
Number of houses = 15 blocks * 12 houses/block = 180 houses
Number of pieces of junk mail = 180 houses * 2 pieces/house = 360 pieces

For the second neighbourhood:
Number of houses = 20 blocks * 18 houses/block = 360 houses
Number of pieces of junk mail = 360 houses * 3 pieces/house = 1080 pieces

For the third neighbourhood:
Number of houses = 10 blocks * 15 houses/block = 150 houses
Number of pieces of junk mail = 150 houses * 4 pieces/house = 600 pieces

Total number of pieces of junk mail to be delivered = 360 pieces (first neighbourhood) + 1080 pieces (second neighbourhood) + 600 pieces (third neighbourhood) = 2040 pieces.","To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of blocks by the number of houses per block and the number of junk mail pieces required for each house across all neighborhoods.

Step 1: 15 blocks x 12 houses/block x 2 pieces/house = 360 pieces of junk mail.

Step 2: 20 blocks x 18 houses/block x 3 pieces/house = 1080 pieces.

Step 3: 10 blocks x 15 houses/block x 4 pieces/house = 600 pieces.

Adding these together gives us a total of 2040 pieces of junk mail that the mailman needs to deliver.

Therefore, the final result is 2040.","To calculate the total number of pieces of junk mail the mailman needs to deliver, we need to multiply the number of houses in each block by the number of pieces of junk mail per house and then sum up the results for each neighborhood.

365,"Initially, there were 4 sparrows and 46 storks sitting on the fence. After 6 more pigeons joined them, 3 sparrows and 5 storks flew away. Later on, 8 swans and 2 ducks also came to sit on the fence. How many birds are sitting on the fence now?","Let's calculate the number of birds on the fence step by step:

Initially, there were:
- 4 sparrows
- 46 storks

Total initial birds = 4 sparrows + 46 storks = 50 birds

After 6 pigeons joined:
- 6 pigeons

Total birds after pigeons joined = 50 initial birds + 6 pigeons = 56 birds

Then 3 sparrows and 5 storks flew away:
- 3 sparrows flew away
- 5 storks flew away

Total birds that flew away = 3 sparrows + 5 storks = 8 birds

Total birds after some flew away = 56 birds - 8 birds = 48 birds

Later on, 8 swans and 2 ducks came to sit on the fence:
- 8 swans
- 2 ducks

Total new birds that came = 8 swans + 2 ducks = 10 birds

Total birds on the fence now = 48 birds + 10 birds = 58 birds

So, there are 58 birds sitting on the fence now.","There were initially 4 + 46 = 50 birds on the fence. After some flew away, there were 4 - 3 = 1 sparrow left and 46 - 5 = 41 storks. When the new birds joined, the total number of birds became 41 + 8 + 2 = 51. 

**Fifty-one**.","Initially, there were 4 sparrows and 46 storks sitting on the fence, making a total of 4 + 46 = 50 birds.

After 6 more pigeons joined them, the total number of birds became 50 + 6 = 56 birds.

Then, 3 sparrows and 5 storks flew away, so the number of sparrows became 4 - 3 = 1 and the number of storks became 46 - 5 = 41.

366,"There were originally 2 birds sitting on the fence. Some more birds came to join them, and they formed 3 different groups. One group had twice as many birds as the second group, and the third group had 4 times as many birds as the first group. If there are a total of 30 birds on the fence now, how many more birds had come to sit on the fence and how many birds are in each group?","Let's denote the number of birds in the second group as x. According to the problem, the first group has twice as many birds as the second group, so the first group has 2x birds. The third group has 4 times as many birds as the first group, so the third group has 4 * 2x = 8x birds.

Now, we know there were originally 2 birds on the fence, and now there are a total of 30 birds. So, the number of birds that came to join the original 2 is 30 - 2 = 28 birds.

The total number of birds in all three groups is the sum of the birds in each group:

First group + Second group + Third group = Total birds
2x + x + 8x = 30 - 2 (since we subtract the original 2 birds)
11x = 28

Now, we solve for x:

x = 28 / 11

Since x must be a whole number (as we can't have a fraction of a bird), and the total number of birds is 30, we need to find a value of x that, when multiplied by 11, gives us a number that is 2 less than 30 (since we subtract the original 2 birds).

The only whole number that satisfies this condition is x = 2 (because 11 * 2 = 22, and 22 + 2 = 24, which is 2 less than 30).

So, the second group has x = 2 birds, the first group has 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 birds, and the third group has 8x = 8 * 2 = 16 birds.

To confirm, we add up the birds in each group plus the original 2 birds:

4 (first group) + 2 (second group) + 16 (third group) + 2 (original birds) = 24 birds

Since we were looking for a total of 30 birds, and we have confirmed that 24 birds are on the fence after adding the original 2, our solution is correct.

Therefore, 28 more birds came to sit on the fence, and the groups have 4, 2, and 16 birds respectively.","Let's analyze this problem step by step. 

We start with two birds, and we'll call this Group A. It's given that the new Group B has half the number of birds as Group A, and Group C has four times the number of birds as Group A. 

So, Group A has 2 birds.
Group B has 1/2 x 2 = 1 bird.
Group C has 4 x 2 = 8 birds.
 
The total number of birds that joined the initial two is found by subtracting the current total from the final total: 30 birds - (2 + 1 + 8) = 19 new birds.
 
Therefore, the result is 19.
 
Peace.","Let's denote the number of birds in the first group as x. According to the information given, the second group has twice as many birds as the first group, so it has 2x birds. The third group has 4 times as many birds as the first group, so it has 4x birds.

The total number of birds on the fence is given as 30. Since there were originally 2 birds on the fence, the number of birds that came to join them is 30 - 2 = 28.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the total number of birds:

x + 2x + 4x = 30

Combining like terms, we get:

7x = 30

Now, we divide both sides by 7 to solve for x:

x = 30 / 7

x = 4.2857...

Since we can't have a fraction of a bird, we'll round x to the nearest whole number. The closest whole number to 4.2857... is 4.

So, the first group has 4 birds, the second group has 2x = 2 * 4 = 8 birds, and the third group has 4x = 4 * 4 = 16 birds.

Now, let's calculate the number of birds that came to join them:

28 = 4 + 8 + 16

$40 (current amount) - $19 (amount last week) = $21

Fred earned $21 over the weekend.","To solve the problem, we need to find out how much money Fred has earned over the weekend. We can start by calculating the total earnings from car washing:
Total earnings = Fred's earnings + Jason's earnings + Sarah's earnings

We know the final amount each of them has:
Fred: 40 dollars
Jason: 69 dollars
Sarah: 58 dollars

We are given the percentages of the total cars each person washed:
Fred: 35%
Jason: 30%
Sarah: 35%

We can calculate the earnings of each person:
Fred's earnings = 35% of the total earnings
Jason's earnings = 30% of the total earnings
Sarah's earnings = 35% of the total earnings

Since we can't have a fraction of a dollar, we'll assume the total earnings to be the smallest amount of dollars that everyone's earnings can be represented in. Jason's earnings have the largest value among the three, which is 69 dollars. Therefore, the total earnings equals 69 dollars. 

Now, we can find Fred's earnings:
Fred's earnings = 35% of 69 dollars
Fred's earnings = 24.15 dollars

Fred earned $24.15 over the weekend.

$24.15","Let's denote the total number of cars they washed as C.

According to the information given, Fred washed 35% of the total cars, Jason washed 30%, and Sarah washed the remaining 35%. We can express this as follows:

Fred's share = 35% of C
Jason's share = 30% of C
Sarah's share = 35% of C

We are given that by the end of the weekend, Fred had 40 dollars, Jason had 69 dollars, and Sarah had 58 dollars. We can set up equations based on the percentage of cars each of them washed and the total amount of money they earned:

For Fred:
35% of C = 40
For Jason:
30% of C = 69
For Sarah:
35% of C = 58

Now, let's solve for C:

Fred's equation:
0.35 * C = 40
C = 40 / 0.35
C = 114.29 (approximately)

Since the number of cars they washed must be a whole number, we can round C to the nearest whole number. Since 114.29 is closer to 115 than to 114, we'll round C to 115.

Now that we have the total number of cars they washed, we can find out how much money each of them earned:

Fred's earnings = 35% of 115 = 0.35 * 115 = 40
Jason's earnings = 30% of 115 = 0.30 * 115 = 34.50 (approximately)
Sarah's earnings = 35% of 115 = 0.35 * 115 = 40

Now, let's find out how much money Fred earned over the weekend:

Fred's earnings over the weekend = 40 - 19 = 21 dollars

So, Fred earned 21 dollars over the weekend.",24.15,21,21
374,"The Razorback shop makes $115 off each jersey and $25 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys. For this game day, there was a 10% discount on jerseys and a 15% discount on t-shirts. The shop also charges an 8% sales tax on all items, and a $5 shipping fee per jersey and $3 shipping fee per t-shirt for online orders. Calculate the final cost of a jersey and a t-shirt, taking into account discounts, taxes, and shipping fees, and determine how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt.","First, let's calculate the discounted price for a jersey and a t-shirt.

For the jersey:
Original price = $115
Discount = 10% of $115 = 0.10 * $115 = $11.50
Discounted price = $115 - $11.50 = $103.50

For the t-shirt:
Original price = $25
Discount = 15% of $25 = 0.15 * $25 = $3.75
Discounted price = $25 - $3.75 = $21.25

Now, let's add the sales tax to the discounted prices.

Sales tax for the jersey:
Sales tax = 8% of $103.50 = 0.08 * $103.50 = $8.28
Price with tax = $103.50 + $8.28 = $111.78

Sales tax for the t-shirt:
Sales tax = 8% of $21.25 = 0.08 * $21.25 = $1.70
Price with tax = $21.25 + $1.70 = $22.95

Next, we add the shipping fees to the price with tax.

Final cost of a jersey:
Shipping fee = $5
Final cost = $111.78 + $5 = $116.78

Final cost of a t-shirt:
Shipping fee = $3
Final cost = $22.95 + $3 = $25.95

Finally, let's determine how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt.

Difference in cost = Final cost of a jersey - Final cost of a t-shirt
Difference in cost = $116.78 - $25.95 = $90.83

So, a jersey costs $90.83 more than a t-shirt after taking into account discounts, taxes, and shipping fees.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the discount amounts for each jersey and t-shirt. For jerseys: 10% x $115 = $11.50 off. For t-shirts: 15% x $25 = $3.75 off.

2. Determine the pre-tax price. Jerseys: $115 - $11.50 = $103.50. T-shirts: $25 - $3.75 = $21.25.

3. Calculate the sales tax. Jerseys: 8% x $103.50 = $8.28. T-shirts: 8% x $21.25 = $1.70.

4. Add the shipping fee. Jerseys: $103.50 + $8.28 + $5 = $116.78. T-shirts: $21.25 + $1.70 + $3 = $26.65.

5. Find the difference in cost between the jersey and the t-shirt: $116.78 - $26.65 = $90.13. 

The final result is ninety-zero cents.","First, let's calculate the discounts and taxes for each item.

For the jerseys:
- Discount: 10% of $115 = 0.10 * $115 = $11.50
- Sales tax: 8% of $115 = 0.08 * $115 = $9.20
- Shipping fee: $5

For the t-shirts:
- Discount: 15% of $25 = 0.15 * $25 = $3.75
- Sales tax: 8% of $25 = 0.08 * $25 = $2.00
- Shipping fee: $3

Now, let's calculate the final cost for each item:

For the jerseys:
- Discount: $11.50
- Sales tax: $9.20
- Shipping fee: $5
- Total discount and taxes: $11.50 + $9.20 + $5 = $25.70
- Final cost for jerseys: $115 - $25.70 = $89.30

For the t-shirts:
- Discount: $3.75
- Sales tax: $2.00
- Shipping fee: $3
- Total discount and taxes: $3.75 + $2.00 + $3 = $8.75
- Final cost for t-shirts: $25 - $8.75 = $16.25

Now, let's find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt:

Difference in cost = Cost of jerseys - Cost of t-shirts
Difference in cost = $89.30 - $16.25 = $73.05

So, a jersey costs $73.05 more than a t-shirt.",ninety zero,73.05,90.83
375,"Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books on a shelf in his room. Later he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. He then decided to arrange action figures and books on the shelf in an alternating pattern with the action figures occurring twice as often as the books. If Jerry still needs to add more books to complete the pattern, how many more books does he need to add?","Jerry initially had 5 action figures and added 7 more, making a total of 5 + 7 = 12 action figures.

He has 9 books.

The pattern is such that action figures occur twice as often as books. Let's denote the number of action figures as ""F"" and the number of books as ""B"". The pattern would look like this: F F B F F B F F B ...

To find out how many groups of the pattern (F F B) we can make with 12 action figures, we divide the number of action figures by 2 (since there are 2 action figures for every book in the pattern):

12 action figures / 2 = 6 groups

Each group consists of 1 book. So for 6 groups, we would need 6 books. Jerry already has 9 books, which is more than enough to complete the pattern with the 12 action figures.

However, since Jerry has 9 books, we can try to use all of them in the pattern. To do this, we need to find out how many action figures we would need for 9 books, given the pattern F F B.

For 9 books, we would need 9 * 2 = 18 action figures to maintain the pattern.

Jerry has 12 action figures, so he does not need to add any more books to complete the pattern; in fact, he has 3 extra books. If he wants to use all 9 books, he would need to acquire 18 - 12 = 6 more action figures.","Jerry started with 5 action figures which, combined with the twice as often pattern requirement, means he needs 10 books to complete the pattern. As he only has 9 books, he requires **1 more book**.","Jerry started with 5 action figures and 9 books. After adding 7 more action figures, he had a total of 5 + 7 = 12 action figures.

He wants to arrange the action figures and books in an alternating pattern with the action figures occurring twice as often as the books. This means that for every 2 action figures, there will be 1 book.

To find out how many more books Jerry needs to add to complete the pattern, we need to determine how many more books he can add before the number of action figures becomes less than the number of books.

Let's assume Jerry has added all the books he can before the number of action figures becomes less than the number of books. In this case, the number of action figures would be equal to the number of books.

Since Jerry started with 5 action figures and added 7 more, he has a total of 5 + 7 = 12 action figures.

If Jerry adds 12 books (which is the maximum number of books he can add before the number of action figures becomes less than the number of books), the number of action figures would be equal to the number of books.

Therefore, Jerry needs to add 12 - 9 = 3 more books to complete the pattern.",1.,3,6

If she distributes her marbles equally among the boys, how many marbles will each boy receive, and how many marbles, if any, will be left?","To distribute the marbles equally among the 7 boys, we divide the total number of marbles by the number of boys.

50 marbles ÷ 7 boys = 7 marbles per boy with a remainder.

To find out the exact number of marbles each boy gets and the remainder, we can use long division.

50 divided by 7 is 7 with a remainder of 1.

So, each boy will receive 7 marbles, and there will be 1 marble left over.","Haley has a total of 50 marbles which can be divided among the 7 boys in her class. To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of marbles by the number of boys:

50 ÷ 7 = 7 marbles per boy

With 1 marble left over.

Therefore, the result is 7.","Haley has 50 marbles. If she distributes these marbles equally among the 7 boys in her class, we can calculate the number of marbles each boy will receive by dividing the total number of marbles by the number of boys:

50 marbles ÷ 7 boys = 7.142857142857143 marbles per boy

Since we can't give a fraction of a marble to each boy, we'll have to round down to the nearest whole number. Each boy will receive 7 marbles.

To find out how many marbles will be left, we subtract the number of marbles each boy receives from the total number of marbles:

50 marbles - (7 marbles/boy * 7 boys) = 50 marbles - 49 marbles = 1 marble

So, each boy will receive 7 marbles, and there will be 1 marble left.",7,1,7
377,"Paul got a box of 440 crayons for his birthday. He gave 111 crayons to each of his 5 friends. If he has lost 17% of the crayons from the box, find out how many crayons he has left.","First, let's find out how many crayons Paul gave away to his friends. Since he gave 111 crayons to each of his 5 friends, we can calculate this by multiplying 111 by 5:

111 crayons/friend * 5 friends = 555 crayons

Now, let's find out how many crayons Paul lost. Since he lost 17% of the crayons from the box, we can calculate this by finding 17% of 440:

17% of 440 crayons = 0.17 * 440 = 74.8 crayons

Since Paul can't lose a fraction of a crayon, we'll round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round down because you can't lose part of a crayon:

74.8 crayons ≈ 74 crayons

Now, let's find out how many crayons Paul has left after giving some to his friends and losing some. We'll subtract the number of crayons he gave away and the number of crayons he lost from the original number of crayons:

440 crayons (original amount) - 555 crayons (given away) - 74 crayons (lost) = -189 crayons

This result doesn't make sense because Paul can't have a negative number of crayons. It seems there might be a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the situation:

Paul started with 440 crayons. He gave away 555 crayons to his friends, which is more than he had in the box. This is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem statement or in the interpretation of the problem.

If the problem statement is correct and Paul indeed gave away 555 crayons, then he must have had additional crayons outside of the box of 440 crayons to be able to give away that many. However, with the information provided, we cannot accurately determine how many crayons Paul has left. Please check the problem statement and provide the correct information.","Paul had 440 crayons to start with, and he gave away 5 * 111 crayons, which is 555 crayons in total. After this, Paul has 440 - 555 crayons, which is -115 crayons. Considering that negative numbers of crayons don't make sense, we can assume that Paul has given away all his crayons.

Zero.","Paul gave away 111 crayons to each of his 5 friends, so he gave away a total of:

111 crayons/friend * 5 friends = 555 crayons

After giving away these crayons, Paul had:

She made three transactions: spending 15 US dollars at a supermarket, buying a book worth 10 euros, and paying for lunch which cost 12 US dollars. How much money does she have left in US dollars?","First, let's convert Olivia's 50 Euros to US dollars using the exchange rate provided.

50 Euros * 1.20 US dollars/Euro = 60 US dollars

Now, let's add this to her initial amount of US dollars.

78 US dollars + 60 US dollars = 138 US dollars

Next, let's subtract the amounts she spent from her total in US dollars.

She spent 15 US dollars at the supermarket, so:

138 US dollars - 15 US dollars = 123 US dollars

She bought a book worth 10 euros, which we need to convert to US dollars:

10 Euros * 1.20 US dollars/Euro = 12 US dollars

Now, let's subtract this amount:

123 US dollars - 12 US dollars = 111 US dollars

Each chocolate cake was sold for $10, each vanilla cake for $12, and each strawberry cake for $15. He also made 153 pastries, with each pastry sold for $5. If Baker sold 30 chocolate cakes, 25 vanilla cakes, 20 strawberry cakes, and 106 pastries, what was the total profit difference between the cakes and pastries sold?","First, let's calculate the total revenue from the cakes sold:

- Chocolate cakes: 30 sold * $10 each = $300
- Vanilla cakes: 25 sold * $12 each = $300
- Strawberry cakes: 20 sold * $15 each = $300

Now, let's add up the revenue from all the cakes sold:
Total cake revenue = $300 (chocolate) + $300 (vanilla) + $300 (strawberry) = $900

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the pastries sold:
- Pastries: 106 sold * $5 each = $530

Finally, let's find the difference in profit between the cakes and pastries sold:
Profit difference = Total cake revenue - Total pastry revenue
Profit difference = $900 (cakes) - $530 (pastries) = $370

The total profit difference between the cakes and pastries sold is $370.","Let's calculate the profit from the cakes and pastries sold by the baker:

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from the cakes first. From the information given, the baker sold 30 chocolate cakes at $10 each, which equals $300. He sold 25 vanilla cakes for $12 each, totaling $300. For the strawberry cakes, 20 cakes sold at $15 each give a revenue of $300. So, the total revenue from the cakes is $300 + $300 + $300 = $900.

Step 2: Next, calculate the cost of the pastries. The baker sold 106 pastries at $5 each, which amounts to $530.

Step 3: Now, subtract the cost of the pastries from the revenue of the cakes to find the profit difference. $900 (cake revenue) - $530 (pastry cost) = $370.

The profit difference between the cakes and pastries sold is $370.

The final result: Seven Hundred and Thirty Dollars.","First, let's calculate the total profit from the cakes and pastries sold:

380,"In a school program, there are 676 attendees in total. Out of these attendees, 22 are parents, who represent 15% of the entire parent population. Additionally, 18 staff members, which represent 60% of the total staff, are present. How many students are present at the program, and what percentage do they represent of the total student population?","First, let's find out the total number of parents and staff based on the percentages given.

For parents:
22 parents represent 15% of the entire parent population. To find the total number of parents, we can set up a proportion:

15% / 100% = 22 / Total Parents
0.15 = 22 / Total Parents
Total Parents = 22 / 0.15
Total Parents = 146.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round to the nearest whole number. It's not clear whether we should round up or down, but typically, when dealing with people, we round up to ensure everyone is accounted for. So, we'll say there are 147 parents in total.

For staff:
18 staff members represent 60% of the total staff. To find the total number of staff, we can set up a similar proportion:

60% / 100% = 18 / Total Staff
0.60 = 18 / Total Staff
Total Staff = 18 / 0.60
Total Staff = 30

Now, let's find out how many students are present. We know the total number of attendees is 676, which includes parents, staff, and students. We'll subtract the number of parents and staff from the total to find the number of students:

Total Attendees = Total Parents + Total Staff + Total Students
676 = 147 + 30 + Total Students
676 = 177 + Total Students
Total Students = 676 - 177
Total Students = 499

So, there are 499 students present at the program.

To find the percentage of the total student population that these 499 students represent, we would need to know the total student population. However, this information is not provided in the question, so we cannot calculate the percentage of the total student population that is present.","There are 480 students present, representing 85% of the total student body.

To solve, we first determine the total parent population by dividing the parent attendance by the attendance percentage: 22 parents / 0.15 = 146.67, rounded up to 147. 

Next, we find the total staff population by performing a similar operation: 18 staff / 0.6 = 30 staff members. 

Now, we subtract the total parents and staff members from the whole program attendance to find the student attendance: 676 - 147 - 30 = 480. 

To find the percentage of students present, we first divide the student attendance by the total student body and then multiply by 100: 480 / 147 * 100 = 85%. 

Therefore, the final result is 85%.","Let's denote the total parent population as P. According to the information given, 22 parents are present, which represent 15% of the total parent population. We can set up the following equation:

22 = 0.15 * P

Now, we can solve for P:

P = 22 / 0.15
P = 146.67

Since the number of parents can't be a fraction, we'll round it to the nearest whole number:

P = 147

Now, we know that 18 staff members are present, which represent 60% of the total staff. Let's denote the total staff population as S. We can set up another equation:

18 = 0.60 * S

Now, we can solve for S:

S = 18 / 0.60
S = 30

Now, we know that there are 676 attendees in total, and 22 of them are parents and 18 are staff members. To find out how many students are present, we subtract the number of parents and staff from the total number of attendees:

Number of students = Total attendees - (Parents + Staff)
Number of students = 676 - (22 + 18)
Number of students = 676 - 40
Number of students = 636

Now, we need to find out what percentage the students represent of the total student population. Let's denote the total student population as T. We know that the total number of attendees is 676, and 636 of them are students. We can set up the following equation:

636 = 0.?? * T

Now, we can solve for the percentage:

0.?? = 636 / T

2. Next, we'll add up the total number of functioning seats:
8 + 18 + 18 = 34 seats

3. Finally, we'll multiply the total number of seats by the capacity of each seat:
34 seats × 15 people per seat = 510 people

**510**","To find out how many people can ride all the functioning seats in the three Ferris wheels at the same time, we need to calculate the number of functioning seats in each Ferris wheel and then add them together.

For the second Ferris wheel:
25 seats - 7 broken seats = 18 functioning seats

For the third Ferris wheel:
30 seats - 12 broken seats = 18 functioning seats

Now, we add the functioning seats from all three Ferris wheels:
8 functioning seats (first Ferris wheel) + 18 functioning seats (second Ferris wheel) + 18 functioning seats (third Ferris wheel) = 44 functioning seats

Each functioning seat can hold 15 people, so we multiply the number of functioning seats by the number of people each seat can hold:
44 functioning seats * 15 people per seat = 660 people

Therefore, 660 people can ride all the functioning seats in the three Ferris wheels at the same time.",510,660,660

A group of 17 would imply that each group should have 17 eggs, not 13. 

If we assume that she wants to make groups with 13 eggs in each, and she wants to know how many groups of 13 she can make from a collection of eggs that can be divided into groups of 17, then we can calculate it as follows:

1 group of 17 eggs = 17 eggs
1 group of 13 eggs = 13 eggs

To find out how many groups of 13 eggs she can make from a group of 17 eggs, we divide 17 by 13:

17 eggs ÷ 13 eggs/group = 1.30769231 groups

Since you can't have a fraction of a group, we can only make 1 full group of 13 eggs from a group of 17 eggs, with 4 eggs left over (17 - 13 = 4).

If the question is asking how many total eggs she has if she has multiple groups of 17 eggs, each with 13 eggs, then the question is contradictory because a group of 17 eggs should contain 17 eggs, not 13.

Number of roses added = 24 (current) - 5 (initial) = 19 roses
Number of orchids added = 10 (current) - 3 (initial) = 7 orchids
Number of tulips added = 16 (current) - 4 (initial) = 12 tulips

Now, we have the total number of each flower type in the vase:
Roses: 24
Orchids: 10
Tulips: 16

The ratio of roses to orchids to tulips is therefore 24:10:16.

To simplify the ratio, we can divide each number by the greatest common divisor of the three numbers. In this case, the greatest common divisor is 2.

Simplified ratio:
Roses: 24 / 2 = 12
Orchids: 10 / 2 = 5
Tulips: 16 / 2 = 8

So, the simplified ratio of roses to orchids to tulips is 12:5:8.

To determine the percentage each flower type represents in the vase, we first need to find the total number of flowers in the vase.

Total flowers = 24 roses + 10 orchids + 16 tulips = 50 flowers

Now, we calculate the percentage for each flower type:

Percentage of roses = (24 roses / 50 total flowers) * 100 = 48%
Percentage of orchids = (10 orchids / 50 total flowers) * 100 = 20%
Percentage of tulips = (16 tulips / 50 total flowers) * 100 = 32%

389,"If Lewis earns $1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season, and his weekly earnings increase by x% every year, how much money will he earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons?","To calculate the total amount of money Lewis will earn over 73 harvest seasons, we need to consider the increase in his weekly earnings by x% every year. Let's break down the calculation into steps:

1. Calculate the total earnings for one harvest season.
2. Calculate the total earnings for 73 harvest seasons, considering the annual increase in weekly earnings.

Step 1: Total earnings for one harvest season
Lewis earns $1357 every week for 223 weeks in one harvest season. So, his total earnings for one season would be:
Total earnings for one season = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks
Total earnings for one season = $1357 * 223

Step 2: Total earnings for 73 harvest seasons with an annual increase
To calculate the total earnings over 73 harvest seasons with an annual increase in weekly earnings, we need to apply the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is:
S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)
where:
- S_n is the sum of the first n terms
- a is the first term of the series
- r is the common ratio (1 + x/100 in this case, since the earnings increase by x% each year)
- n is the number of terms (73 harvest seasons in this case)

The first term (a) is the total earnings for the first harvest season, which we calculated in Step 1. The common ratio (r) is 1 + x/100, as the earnings increase by x% each year.

Let's denote the total earnings for the first season as E1 (which is $1357 * 223). The sum of the earnings over 73 harvest seasons would be:
S_73 = E1 * (1 - (1 + x/100)^73) / (1 - (1 + x/100))

Since we don't have the value of x (the percentage increase), we cannot calculate the exact total earnings. However, if you provide the value of x, we can plug it into the formula and calculate the total earnings for Lewis over 73 harvest seasons.","Let's solve this progressive earnings scenario! 

We start with Lewis' weekly earnings: $1357. If this amount increases by a yearly percentage x, we first need to determine the weekly increase after 223 weeks. For this, we'll use the formula for compound interest:
P(1 + r/n)^(nt) - P = 0, where P is the principal amount (weekly earnings), r is the rate of increase (x), n is the number of times the interest is compounded (1 week), and t is the number of years. 

Plugging in, we get: $1357 * (1 + x/52)^(52*223) - $1357 = 0

Solving this equation gives us: x = 11.59%. 

Now we can calculate the earnings for 73 harvest seasons.

$1357 * (1 + 11.59%/52)^(52*73) = $496,669.97

Lewis will earn **close to half a million dollars**.","First, let's find out how much Lewis earns in one harvest season. Since he earns $1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season, we can calculate his total earnings for one season by multiplying his weekly earnings by the number of weeks:

Total earnings for one season = Weekly earnings × Number of weeks
Total earnings for one season = $1357 × 223
Total earnings for one season = $301,031

Now, let's assume that Lewis's weekly earnings increase by x% every year. This means that his earnings in the second year will be (1 + x/100) times his earnings in the first year, and so on for each subsequent year.

Let's denote the increase in earnings as y, which is equal to x/100. Then, his earnings in the second year will be:

Earnings in the second year = (1 + y) × Earnings in the first year
Earnings in the second year = (1 + y) × $301,031

And his earnings in the third year will be:

Earnings in the third year = (1 + y) × Earnings in the second year
Earnings in the third year = (1 + y) × [(1 + y) × $301,031]

We can continue this pattern for the fourth year, fifth year, and so on, until we reach the 73rd year.

However, since we are looking for the total earnings over 73 harvest seasons, we can simplify the calculation by considering the average earnings per season and then multiplying that by the number of seasons.

Let's denote the average earnings per season as A. Then, we can express the total earnings over 73 seasons as:

Total earnings over 73 seasons = A × 73

Now, let's find the average earnings per season (A) by dividing the total earnings for one season by the number of weeks in one season:

A = Total earnings for one season / Number of weeks in one season
A = $301,031 / 223
A = $1350.50

Now we have the average earnings per season, which is $1350.50. To find the total earnings over 73 seasons, we multiply the average earnings per season by the number of seasons:

Total earnings over 73 seasons = A × 73
Total earnings over 73 seasons = $1350.50 × 73
Total earnings over 73 seasons = $97,086.50

So, Lewis will earn $97,086.50 if he works for",half a million dollars,97086.50,S_73

1. Oranges: Philip has 87 oranges and wants to divide them into 3 equal groups.
   87 oranges ÷ 3 groups = 29 oranges per group

2. Bananas: Philip has 290 bananas and wants to divide them into 5 equal groups.
   290 bananas ÷ 5 groups = 58 bananas per group

3. Apples: Philip has 157 apples and wants to divide them into 4 equal groups.
   Since 157 is not divisible by 4, we need to find the nearest number that is divisible by 4 and then find the remainder.
   The nearest multiple of 4 is 156 (which is 39 * 4), so we have 1 apple left over.
   156 apples ÷ 4 groups = 39 apples per group
   There will be 1 apple that cannot be evenly distributed.

4. Grapes: Philip has 56 grapes and wants to divide them into 7 groups such that 1 group has double the number of grapes as the other 6 groups.
   Let's assume each of the 6 groups has x grapes. Then the 7th group will have 2x grapes.
   So, 6x + 2x = 56
   8x = 56
   x = 56 ÷ 8
   x = 7 grapes per group for the 6 groups
   And for the 7th group: 2x = 2 * 7 = 14 grapes

Now we have the number of fruits in each group for all types of fruits:
- Oranges: 29 per group
- Bananas: 58 per group
- Apples: 39 per group (with 1 apple left over)
- Grapes: 7 per group for 6 groups, and 14 for the 7th group","First, we need to divide the number of oranges into 3 equal groups: 87/3 = 29 oranges/group.

Third, we divide the apples into 4 equal groups: 157/4 = 39.25 apples/group (rounding down to the nearest whole number as fruits cannot be split): 39 apples/group. 

For the grapes, we first divide them into 6 equal groups: 56/6 = 9.33 grapes/group (again, rounding down to the nearest whole number): 9 grapes/group. 

Two of these groups will each have twice the number of grapes: 2 x 9 = 18 grapes/group.

The number of fruits in each group, for all types, is therefore 29. 

The result is 29.","First, let's find out how many fruits are in each group for each type of fruit:

Oranges:
Philip has 87 oranges, and he wants to divide them into 3 equal groups. To find out how many oranges are in each group, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups:
87 oranges ÷ 3 groups = 29 oranges per group

Bananas:
Philip has 290 bananas, and he wants to divide them into 5 equal groups. To find out how many bananas are in each group, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups:
290 bananas ÷ 5 groups = 58 bananas per group

Apples:
Philip has 157 apples, and he wants to divide them into 4 equal groups. To find out how many apples are in each group, we divide the total number of apples by the number of groups:
157 apples ÷ 4 groups = 39.25 apples per group

Since we can't have a fraction of an apple in a group, we need to adjust the number of groups or the total number of apples to make it divisible by the number of groups. Let's assume that Philip has 156 apples (which is divisible by 4) instead of 157. Now, we can find out how many apples are in each group:
156 apples ÷ 4 groups = 39 apples per group

Grapes:
Philip has 56 grapes, and he wants to divide them into 7 groups such that 1 group has double the number of grapes as the other 6 groups. To find out how many grapes are in each group, we first find out how many grapes are in the group with double the number of grapes:
56 grapes ÷ 2 = 28 grapes per group (double the number of grapes)

Now, we find out how many grapes are in each of the other 6 groups:
28 grapes ÷ 6 groups = 4.67 grapes per group

Since we can't have a fraction of a grape in a group, we need to adjust the number of grapes or the number of groups to make it divisible by the number of groups. Let's assume that Philip has 55 grapes (which is divisible by 7) instead of 56. Now, we can find out how many grapes are in each group:

Find the distance each animal jumped, given that G = 39 inches.","Given that the grasshopper jumped G inches and G = 39 inches, we can start by finding the distance the frog jumped.

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so we can write the following equation for the frog's jump:

G = F + 19

Substituting the value of G, we get:

39 = F + 19

Now, we can solve for F:

F = 39 - 19
F = 20 inches

So, the frog jumped 20 inches.

Next, we can find the distance the mouse jumped. The mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so we can write:

M = F - 12

Substituting the value of F, we get:

M = 20 - 12
M = 8 inches

So, the mouse jumped 8 inches.

Finally, we can find the distance the kangaroo jumped. The kangaroo jumped twice the distance the frog jumped minus 5 inches, so we can write:

K = 2F - 5

Substituting the value of F, we get:

K = 2(20) - 5
K = 40 - 5
K = 35 inches

So, the kangaroo jumped 35 inches.

In summary, the distances each animal jumped are:
- Grasshopper: G = 39 inches
- Frog: F = 20 inches
- Mouse: M = 8 inches
- Kangaroo: K = 35 inches","1. We're given that the grasshopper jumped 39 inches, which means the frog jumped 39 - 19 = 20 inches.

3. The kangaroo jumped twice the frog's distance minus 5 inches, so 2 * 20 - 5 = 35 inches. 

The animals jumped: 
Grasshopper - 39 inches
Frog - 20 inches
Mouse - 8 inches
Kangaroo - 35 inches.

Success!","Let's denote the frog's jump as F inches. According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump is G = F + 19 inches. We are also told that G = 39 inches, so we can write:

F + 19 = 39

Now, let's solve for F:

F = 39 - 19
F = 20 inches

Now that we know the frog jumped 20 inches, we can find the distance the mouse jumped. The mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so:

M = F - 12
M = 20 - 12
M = 8 inches

Next, we need to find the distance the kangaroo jumped. The kangaroo jumped twice the distance the frog jumped minus 5 inches. So:

K = 2F - 5
K = 2(20) - 5
K = 40 - 5
K = 35 inches

In summary:

- The grasshopper jumped 39 inches.
- The frog jumped 20 inches.
- The mouse jumped 8 inches.
- The kangaroo jumped 35 inches.",Success!,35,35
394,"Nell collects baseball cards. She had 573 cards initially and bought 127 more from a local shop. Afterward, she gave 195 cards to John, 75 cards to Jimmy, and 6% of her remaining cards to Jeff. Now she has 210 cards left. How many cards did Nell give to Jeff?","Let's calculate step by step.

Nell initially had 573 cards and bought 127 more, so she had:
573 + 127 = 700 cards

Then she gave away 195 cards to John and 75 cards to Jimmy, so she gave away in total:
195 + 75 = 270 cards

After giving away these cards, she had:
700 - 270 = 430 cards

She then gave 6% of her remaining cards to Jeff. Let's find out how many cards that was. 6% of 430 is:
6/100 * 430 = 25.8 cards

Since she can't give away a fraction of a card, we'll assume she gave away 26 cards to Jeff (rounding up to the nearest whole card).

After giving away these cards to Jeff, she had 210 cards left. So, before giving cards to Jeff, she had:
210 + 26 = 236 cards

Therefore, Nell gave 26 cards to Jeff.","Nell started with 573 cards and bought 127, ending up with 700 in total. She then gave away 195 + 75 = 270 cards to John and Jimmy. With the remaining 430 cards, Nell gave 430 x 6/100 = 258 cards to Jeff.

395,"A grocery store had 780 bottles of regular soda, 530 bottles of diet soda, 420 bottles of lite soda, and 320 bottles of zero-sugar soda. What percentage more bottles of regular soda did they have than diet soda?","To find out what percentage more bottles of regular soda the store had than diet soda, we first need to find the difference in the number of bottles between the two types of soda.

Difference in number of bottles = Number of regular soda bottles - Number of diet soda bottles
Difference in number of bottles = 780 - 530
Difference in number of bottles = 250

Now, we need to find out what percentage this difference is of the number of diet soda bottles.

Percentage more = (Difference in number of bottles / Number of diet soda bottles) * 100
Percentage more = (250 / 530) * 100

Now, we calculate the percentage:

Percentage more ≈ 47.17%

So, the grocery store had approximately 47.17% more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.","We are asked to compare the number of bottles of regular soda with the number of diet soda bottles. We will follow these steps to solve the problem:
1. Identify the values - We have been given:
- Regular soda: 780 bottles
- Diet soda: 530 bottles

2. Calculate the difference - To find the excess amount of regular soda bottles, we subtract the number of diet soda bottles from the regular soda bottles:
780 - 530 = 250 bottles

3. Convert the difference to a percentage - To get the percentage, we divide the difference by the number of diet soda bottles and multiply by 100:
250 / 530 * 100 = 47.17... %

So, the grocery store has approximately 47% more regular soda bottles than diet soda bottles.","To find the percentage more bottles of regular soda the grocery store had than diet soda, we first need to calculate the difference between the number of bottles of regular soda and the number of bottles of diet soda.

396,"If the original price of each pack of DVDs is 81 dollars, and there's a 15% discount on the packs, followed by a 7% sales tax added to the discounted price, how much will it cost to buy 33 packs of DVDs?","First, let's calculate the discounted price for one pack of DVDs.

The discount on one pack is 15% of $81, which is:
0.15 * $81 = $12.15

Subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:
$81 - $12.15 = $68.85

Now, let's calculate the sales tax on the discounted price. The sales tax is 7% of $68.85, which is:
0.07 * $68.85 = $4.8195

Since we usually don't deal with fractions of a cent in currency, we'll round the sales tax to the nearest cent, which is $4.82.

Add the sales tax to the discounted price to get the final price for one pack:
$68.85 + $4.82 = $73.67

Now, to find the total cost for 33 packs, multiply the final price for one pack by 33:
$73.67 * 33 = $2431.11

Therefore, it will cost $2431.11 to buy 33 packs of DVDs.","To solve this problem, we should first find the discount and then calculate the sales tax. 

Step 1:
The discount on each pack is 15% x $81 = $12.15.

Step 2:
The discounted price for each pack is $81 - $12.15 = $68.85.

Step 3:
The sales tax amount is 7% x $68.85 = $4.82 per pack.

Step 4:
The final price for one pack is $68.85 + $4.82 = $73.67.

Step 5:
33 packs x $73.67 = $2390.11

Therefore, the final price for 33 packs of DVDs is two thousand, three hundred and ninety dollars and eleven cents.
$2390.11","First, let's calculate the discount on each pack of DVDs. Since the discount is 15%, we multiply the original price by 0.15 to find the discount amount:

81 dollars * 0.15 = 12.15 dollars

81 dollars - 12.15 dollars = 68.85 dollars

Next, we calculate the sales tax on the discounted price. Since the sales tax is 7%, we multiply the discounted price by 0.07 to find the tax amount:

68.85 dollars * 0.07 = 4.82025 dollars

Now, we add the tax amount to the discounted price to find the final price:

68.85 dollars + 4.82025 dollars = 73.67025 dollars

Finally, we multiply the final price by the number of packs to find the total cost:

How many more birds (both sparrows and swallows) than storks are sitting on the fence now?","Let's calculate the number of each type of bird sitting on the fence after the changes:

Sparrows:
Initially, there were 9 sparrows. Then, 3 more sparrows came.
So, the new number of sparrows = 9 + 3 = 12 sparrows.

Swallows:
Initially, there were 5 swallows. Then, 2 swallows left the fence.
So, the new number of swallows = 5 - 2 = 3 swallows.

Storks:
Initially, there were 4 storks. Then, 3 storks joined and 1 stork flew away.
So, the new number of storks = 4 + 3 - 1 = 6 storks.

Now, let's find out how many more birds (both sparrows and swallows) than storks are sitting on the fence:

Total number of sparrows and swallows = 12 (sparrows) + 3 (swallows) = 15 birds.
Total number of storks = 6 storks.

Difference between the number of sparrows and swallows and the number of storks = 15 (sparrows and swallows) - 6 (storks) = 9 more birds (both sparrows and swallows) than storks are sitting on the fence.","There were initially 9 sparrows + 5 swallows + 4 storks = 18 birds on the fence.

Then 3 sparrows + x swallows joined, where x = 2. So, the number of birds became 18 + 3 + 2 = 23.

Meanwhile, y storks arrived and z storks flew away, where y = 3 and z = 1. The number of storks became 4 + y - z = 6.

Therefore, the number of birds (sparrows and swallows) now on the fence is 23 - 6 = 17.

1 stork flew away, so there were 7 - 1 = 6 storks left.

Now, there are 12 sparrows, 3 swallows, and 6 storks sitting on the fence.

To find out how many more birds (both sparrows and swallows) than storks are sitting on the fence now, we subtract the number of storks from the total number of sparrows and swallows:

398,"Mary is attempting to bake a cake, and the recipe requires maintaining a specific ratio of ingredients: 4 cups of flour, 7 cups of sugar, and 2 cups of salt. She accidentally put in 2 cups of flour instead of 4 cups. How many more cups of flour than cups of salt does she need to add now to maintain the correct ratio of ingredients?","To maintain the correct ratio of ingredients, Mary needs to have twice as many cups of flour as cups of salt, since the original recipe calls for 4 cups of flour and 2 cups of salt (4:2 ratio, which simplifies to 2:1).

Since she has already put in 2 cups of flour, she needs to add 2 more cups of flour to reach the original 4 cups required by the recipe. This will maintain the 2:1 ratio of flour to salt (4 cups of flour to 2 cups of salt).

Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of flour than cups of salt to maintain the correct ratio of ingredients.","Mary needs to add **one more cup of flour**.

Here are the steps to solve:
1. We need to find out how many cups of flour Mary has added incorrectly. We can establish this by halving the target amount: 4 cups of flour / 2 = 2 cups of flour.

2. We know that she has 2 cups of flour, and the ratio for flour is 4:2 (flour:salt). So we can deduce that she has half of the required flour, and therefore has the same amount of salt - also one cup each.

3. The difference in cups of flour is therefore the amount of flour needed to reach the correct ratio. Hence, Mary needs to add one more cup of flour.","To maintain the correct ratio of ingredients, Mary needs to add more cups of flour and cups of salt to balance the ratio.

The original ratio of flour to salt is 4:2, which simplifies to 2:1.

The new ratio of flour to salt is 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1.

To find the difference, we subtract the new ratio of flour to salt from the original ratio of flour to salt:

- 600 grams of milk x 2 = 1200 grams of milk
- 4 eggs x 2 = 8 eggs
- 2 teaspoons of salt x 2 = 4 teaspoons of salt

Since she has already added 300 grams of flour, she needs to add the remaining amount to reach the doubled quantity of flour:

1000 grams (doubled amount) - 300 grams (already added) = 700 grams of flour

Now, let's find out how much more flour she needs to add to the doubled recipe.

The doubled recipe will call for 2 * 500 = 1000 grams of flour. Since she already put in 300 grams, she needs to add 1000 - 300 = 700 more grams of flour to the doubled recipe.

400,"Mary is baking a cake using a recipe that calls for a ratio of 5:3:1 for flour, sugar, and salt. The recipe requires a total of 30 ounces of ingredients. She already added 12 ounces of flour. How many more ounces of flour than sugar does she need to add now, if she hasn't added any sugar yet? Keep in mind that 1 cup of flour weighs 4.5 ounces, and 1 cup of sugar weighs 7.1 ounces.","First, let's find out the total ratio units for the recipe. The ratio is 5:3:1, which means there are 5 parts flour, 3 parts sugar, and 1 part salt, for a total of 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 parts.

The recipe calls for a total of 30 ounces of ingredients. To find out how much each part weighs, we divide the total weight by the number of parts:

30 ounces / 9 parts = 3.333 ounces per part

Now, let's find out how much flour and sugar are needed according to the recipe:

- Flour: 5 parts * 3.333 ounces/part = 16.665 ounces
- Sugar: 3 parts * 3.333 ounces/part = 9.999 ounces

Mary has already added 12 ounces of flour. To find out how much more flour she needs to add:

16.665 ounces (total flour needed) - 12 ounces (flour already added) = 4.665 ounces of flour still needed

Since Mary hasn't added any sugar yet, she needs to add all 9.999 ounces of sugar.

To find out how many more ounces of flour than sugar she needs to add now:

4.665 ounces (flour still needed) - 9.999 ounces (sugar needed) = -5.334 ounces

However, since we're looking for how many more ounces of flour than sugar, we should not have a negative number. This indicates that she actually needs less flour than sugar at this point. Therefore, we can conclude that Mary does not need to add more flour than sugar; instead, she needs to add 5.334 ounces less flour than sugar.","Mary has already added 12 oz of flour, and the recipe requires a 5:3 ratio of flour to sugar. Since the ratio of 5:3 equates to 1.66:1, she has already used more flour than the recipe intends. To maintain the correct ratio, she should add 7.8 ounces of sugar next (12 / 1.66 = 7.2, round up to the nearest 0.8). 

Therefore, Mary needs to add 7.8 - 4.5 = 3.3 more ounces of sugar than flour.

3.3 ounces.","First, let's find out how many ounces of sugar Mary needs to add. Since the ratio of flour to sugar is 5:3, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of sugar needed.

Let's call the amount of sugar needed S. According to the ratio, for every 5 ounces of flour, there are 3 ounces of sugar. So we can write:

5 / S = 3 / 1

Now, we can solve for S:

S = (3 / 1) * (5 / 3)
S = 3 * 5
S = 15

So, Mary needs to add 15 ounces of sugar.

Now, let's find out how many more ounces of flour than sugar she needs to add. We already know she has added 12 ounces of flour, so we need to find out how many more ounces of flour she needs to reach the total of 30 ounces.

The total amount of ingredients needed is 30 ounces, and we know that 12 ounces of flour have already been added. So, we need to find out how many more ounces of flour are needed:

30 (total ounces) - 12 (ounces of flour already added) = 18 (more ounces of flour needed)

Now, let's find out how many more ounces of flour than sugar she needs to add. Since she needs to add 15 ounces of sugar, we subtract the amount of sugar needed from the total amount of flour needed:

If Hanna has 3 more peaches than Jake but 5 less than Lucy, find the total number of peaches that Lucy and Jill have.","Let's start by finding out how many peaches Jake has. Since Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, we subtract 12 from the number of peaches Steven has:

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 12
Jake's peaches = 19 - 12
Jake's peaches = 7

Now, we know that Jake has thrice the number of peaches than Jill. To find out how many peaches Jill has, we divide the number of peaches Jake has by 3:

Jill's peaches = Jake's peaches / 3
Jill's peaches = 7 / 3
Jill's peaches = 2.333...

Since Jill can't have a fraction of a peach, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which means Jill has 2 peaches (assuming we are dealing with whole peaches and not parts of peaches).

Next, Hanna has 3 more peaches than Jake:

Hanna's peaches = Jake's peaches + 3
Hanna's peaches = 7 + 3
Hanna's peaches = 10

Hanna has 5 fewer peaches than Lucy, so to find out how many peaches Lucy has, we add 5 to the number of peaches Hanna has:

Lucy's peaches = Hanna's peaches + 5
Lucy's peaches = 10 + 5
Lucy's peaches = 15

Finally, to find the total number of peaches that Lucy and Jill have, we add their peaches together:

According to the problem, the first set of tables has twice the number of chairs as the second set, so we can write this as:

A = 2B

We also know that there is a total of 20 chairs in the backyard, so we can write this as:

A + B = 20

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for B:

2B + B = 20
3B = 20
B = 20 / 3
B = 6.666...

Since the number of chairs must be a whole number, we can round B down to 6 (since you can't have a fraction of a chair). Now we can find A:

A = 2 * 6
A = 12

So, the first set of tables has 12 chairs and the second set has 6 chairs. This adds up to 18 chairs at the tables (12 + 6 = 18).

A = 2B

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get: 
2B + B = 20
3B = 20

Now, we can solve for B. 
3B = 20 implies B = 6.75, which we will round up to 7 for clarity. 

So, each table in the first set has 2 x 7 = 14 chairs, and each table in the second set has 7 chairs. 

To find the number of additional lounge seats, we subtract the total number of chairs from the total number of guests: 
Additional lounge seats = 30 guests - 20 chairs
That's 10 extra lounge seats available.

So the final result is: 10.","Let's denote the number of chairs per table in the first set as A and the number of chairs per table in the second set as B. According to the information given, the first set of tables has twice the number of chairs as the second set, so we can write:

A = 2B

We are also told that there are 20 chairs in total in the backyard. Since there are two sets of tables, we can write:

A * number of tables in the first set + B * number of tables in the second set = 20

We don't have the number of tables in each set, but we can express the total number of chairs in terms of A and B:

A * (A/2B) + B * (2A/B) = 20

Now, let's simplify the equation:

A^2/B + 2AB = 20

To solve for A and B, we need to find values for A and B that satisfy the equation. Since A = 2B, we can substitute A with 2B in the equation:

2B^2/B + 2 * (2B) = 20

Now, let's simplify the equation:

2B^2 + 4B = 20

To solve for B, we need to find the value of B that makes the equation true. We can factor the equation to make it easier to solve:

2B(B + 2) = 20

Now, let's divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify it:

B(B + 2) = 10

This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for B by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first:

B(B + 2) = 10
B^2 + 2B = 10

Now, let's factor the equation:

B^2 + 2B - 10 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = 2, and c = -10. We can solve for B using the quadratic formula:

B = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

Plugging in the values of a, b, and c, we get:

B = [-2 ± √(2^2 - 4 * 1 * (-10))] / (2 * 1)

B = [-2 ± √(4 - 40)] / 2

B = [-2 ± √(-36)] / 2

B = [-2 ± 6i] /",ten,-2 ± 6i,ten
405,"The school is planning a field trip, and there are a total of 111 students and 18 teachers at the school. Each teacher can chaperone a maximum of 6 students. There are 71 classrooms at the school. The school buses have 3 seats for each student, and 1 seat for every teacher. How many buses are needed to accommodate all the students and teachers while adhering to the chaperone limit?","First, let's calculate the number of teachers needed to chaperone the students. Since each teacher can chaperone a maximum of 6 students, we divide the total number of students by 6 to find out how many teachers are needed:

111 students / 6 students per teacher = 18.5 teachers

Since we can't have half a teacher, we'll need to round up to the next whole number, which means we need 19 teachers to chaperone the students. However, we only have 18 teachers available, so we will use all 18 teachers.

Now, let's calculate the number of seats needed on the buses for the students and teachers. Each student needs 3 seats, and each teacher needs 1 seat:

111 students * 3 seats per student = 333 seats for students
18 teachers * 1 seat per teacher = 18 seats for teachers

Total seats needed = 333 seats for students + 18 seats for teachers = 351 seats

Now, we need to determine how many buses are needed. If each bus has a certain number of seats, we divide the total number of seats needed by the number of seats per bus. However, we don't have the information on how many seats each bus has. We need to know the seating capacity of each bus to calculate the number of buses required. Please provide the seating capacity per bus, or if each bus has a fixed number of seats for students and teachers, we can use that information to calculate the number of buses needed.","There are a total of 111 students and the number of teachers needed to supervise them is 111 / 6 = 18.5 students per teacher. Since we can't have half a teacher, we must round up, which means we need 19 teachers. There are only 18 teachers available, so one more teacher is required.

The number of students who can sit on the buses is 111 students, and the teachers' seats amount to 18 seats. Therefore, the total number of seats available is 129.

With three seats per student, the bus can accommodate 129 / 3 = 43 students. So, the number of buses needed is 43 students / bus x 1 bus = 43.

One bus is also needed to account for the extra teacher, so the final result is 44.","First, let's calculate the number of students each teacher can chaperone:

Each teacher can chaperone a maximum of 6 students. There are 18 teachers, so the total number of students they can chaperone is:

18 teachers * 6 students per teacher = 108 students

Now, let's find out how many students are not being chaperoned by the teachers:

111 students - 108 students = 3 students

These 3 students will need to be on the same bus as their teacher to adhere to the chaperone limit.

Now, let's calculate the number of seats needed for the students and teachers:

For the students:
3 seats per student * 111 students = 333 seats

For the teachers:
1 seat per teacher * 18 teachers = 18 seats

Now, let's add the number of seats for the students and teachers together:

333 seats (students) + 18 seats (teachers) = 351 seats

Finally, let's find out how many buses are needed to accommodate all the students and teachers:

351 seats / 3 seats per bus = 117 buses

So, the school will need 117 buses to accommodate all the students and teachers while adhering to the chaperone limit.",forty four,117,351

If there are a total of 325 pages in the book, how many pages are in the fifth chapter, and what is the average page length per chapter?","To find out how many pages are in the fifth chapter, we need to subtract the total number of pages of the first four chapters from the total number of pages in the book.

The total number of pages in the first four chapters is:
60 (first chapter) + 75 (second chapter) + 56 (third chapter) + 42 (fourth chapter) = 233 pages

Now, subtract this from the total number of pages in the book:
325 (total pages) - 233 (pages in first four chapters) = 92 pages

So, the fifth chapter has 92 pages.

To find the average page length per chapter, we divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters:
325 (total pages) / 5 (number of chapters) = 65 pages per chapter

Therefore, the fifth chapter has 92 pages, and the average page length per chapter is 65 pages.","Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that the total number of pages in the book is 325, and we've been given the length of the first four chapters. We can find the length of the fifth chapter by subtracting the combined length of the first four chapters from the total page count: 
325 pages - (60 + 75 + 56 + 42) pages = 52 pages. 

Therefore, the fifth chapter is 52 pages long. 

Now, to find the average page length per chapter, we'll sum up the length of all chapters and divide by the number of chapters:
(60 + 75 + 56 + 42 + 52) pages / 5 chapters = 65.2 pages per chapter. 

The average page length per chapter is 65.2 pages.

65.2","To find out how many pages are in the fifth chapter, we first need to calculate the total number of pages in the first four chapters.

Now, we subtract this total from the overall total number of pages in the book to find out how many pages are in the fifth chapter:
325 (total pages in the book) - 233 (pages in the first four chapters) = 92 pages

So, there are 92 pages in the fifth chapter.

To find the average page length per chapter, we divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of chapters:

407,"In a candy store, Bobby purchased 1200 pieces of candy. He ate 25% of the candy on the first day. The next day, he ate 300 more pieces. On the third day, he ate 1/4 of the remaining candy. How many pieces of candy did Bobby eat in total over the three days?","Let's calculate how much candy Bobby ate each day and then sum it up.

On the first day, Bobby ate 25% of the 1200 pieces of candy. To find out how much that is, we calculate 25% of 1200:

25% of 1200 = 0.25 * 1200 = 300 pieces

So, Bobby ate 300 pieces on the first day.

After eating 300 pieces on the first day, Bobby had 1200 - 300 = 900 pieces left.

On the second day, he ate 300 more pieces. So now he has 900 - 300 = 600 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 1/4 of the remaining 600 pieces. To find out how much that is, we calculate:

1/4 of 600 = 0.25 * 600 = 150 pieces

So, Bobby ate 150 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up all the candy Bobby ate over the three days:

First day: 300 pieces
Second day: 300 pieces
Third day: 150 pieces

Total candy eaten = 300 + 300 + 150 = 750 pieces

Bobby ate a total of 750 pieces of candy over the three days.","Bobby bought 1200 candies, and it's easy to imagine that 25% of 1200 would be a lot of candy to eat in one day! He must have had a sweet tooth.

Anyway, we can calculate that Bobby ate 300 candies on the first day because 1200 * 25% = 300. The next day he ate an additional 300, and so there were 1200 - 300 = 900 candies left. On the third day, Bobby ate 1/4 of the remaining candy, so he consumed another 900 / 4 = 225 candies.

Adding up all the candies Bobby ate across the three days gives us a total of 300 + 300 + 225 = **525** candies.","On the first day, Bobby ate 25% of the candy, which is 25/100 * 1200 = 300 pieces of candy.

On the second day, he ate 300 more pieces, so he ate a total of 300 + 300 = 600 pieces of candy that day.

After the second day, he had 900 - 600 = 300 pieces of candy left.

On the third day, he ate 1/4 of the remaining candy, which is 300 / 4 = 75 pieces of candy.

Calculate the total number taking into account the number of bird families returning and their average members.","To calculate the total number of individual birds that ultimately flew away for the winter, we need to know the following:

1. The initial total number of individual birds that attempted to fly away for the winter.
2. The number of bird families (X) that returned to their previous location.
3. The average number of members in each returning bird family.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the initial total number of individual birds.
- \( X \) as the number of bird families that returned.
- \( A \) as the average number of members in each returning bird family.

The total number of individual birds that returned would be \( X \times A \).

To find the number of individual birds that ultimately flew away for the winter, we subtract the number of individual birds that returned from the initial total number of birds:

Without the specific values for \( T \), \( X \), and \( A \), we cannot calculate the exact number. Please provide these values to proceed with the calculation.","Let's solve the math problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of birds per family. We'll assume an average of 4 birds per family, as it's a common estimate for bird families. 

We are also given that X bird families returned to their previous location. We'll call this value Y to calculate more easily.

So, for every Y family returns, there are 4 x Y individual birds.

X * 5

Now, to find the total number of individual birds that ultimately flew away for the winter, we need to subtract the number of birds that returned from the total number of birds that originally left for migration.

She purchases two types of packages: small packages that include 3 t-shirts each, and large packages that include 5 t-shirts each. How many small and large packages did she buy?","Let's denote the number of small packages as S and the number of large packages as L.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of packages is 28.
2. The total number of t-shirts is 112.

We can set up two equations based on this information:

Equation 1 (total packages): S + L = 28
Equation 2 (total t-shirts): 3S + 5L = 112

Now we have a system of linear equations that we can solve simultaneously.

From Equation 1, we can express S in terms of L:
S = 28 - L

Now we substitute S in Equation 2 with the expression we found from Equation 1:
3(28 - L) + 5L = 112

Expanding the equation, we get:
84 - 3L + 5L = 112

Combining like terms, we get:
2L = 112 - 84
2L = 28

Dividing both sides by 2 to solve for L, we get:
L = 28 / 2
L = 14

Now that we have the number of large packages, we can find the number of small packages by substituting L back into Equation 1:
S + 14 = 28
S = 28 - 14
S = 14

So, Mom bought 14 small packages and 14 large packages.","Mom bought 28 / 3 = 9 small packages and 28 / 5 = 5 large packages.

Result: 14.","Let's denote the number of small packages as S and the number of large packages as L.

We know that the total number of t-shirts is 112, and each small package contains 3 t-shirts, while each large package contains 5 t-shirts. So we can write the equation:

3S + 5L = 112

Now, let's solve for S and L.

First, we can express L in terms of S:

5L = 112 - 3S

Now, we can solve for L:

L = (112 - 3S) / 5

Now, we can substitute this expression for L back into the original equation:

3S + 5 * ((112 - 3S) / 5) = 112

Now, let's simplify the equation:

3S + 55 - 15S = 112

Combine like terms:

15S + 55 = 112

Subtract 55 from both sides:

15S = 112 - 55
15S = 57

Now, divide both sides by 15 to solve for S:

S = 57 / 15
S = 38

Now that we know S, we can find L by substituting S back into the expression for L:

L = (112 - 3S) / 5
L = (112 - 3 * 38) / 5
L = (112 - 114) / 5
L = -2 / 5

Since the number of packages must be a whole number, we can't have a fraction of a package. This means that the number of large packages is not a whole number, so it's not possible for Mom to have bought exactly 28 packages of white t-shirts that contain 112 white t-shirts in total.

First shelf:
Initially, Jerry has 9 books. After adding 10 more books, the total number of books on the first shelf becomes 9 + 10 = 19 books.

Second shelf:
There are no books mentioned on the second shelf, only puzzles and comic books.

Third shelf:
Jerry has 30% more books than on the first shelf. Initially, the first shelf had 9 books, so the third shelf has 30% more than that.
30% of 9 books = 0.30 * 9 = 2.7 books
Since we can't have a fraction of a book, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. However, in the context of counting books, we would typically round up, as you can't have a fraction of a book and Jerry would have a whole number of books. So we'll consider 3 additional books.

If Ed had 27 marbles, how many marbles did Doug have initially?","If Ed had 27 marbles and he had 5 more than Doug, then Doug initially had 27 - 5 = 22 marbles.

After Doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground, he had 22 - 3 = 19 marbles left.

Then, Doug gave half of his remaining marbles to his friend Chris, so he gave away 19 / 2 = 9.5 marbles. Since Doug can't give away half a marble, we'll assume he gave away 9 marbles and kept the other half, which is also 9 marbles.

Therefore, Doug initially had 22 marbles.","Let's solve this together!

We know Ed has 27 marbles, and Doug has 5 less. We can represent Doug's marbles as 27 - 5 = 22.

Doug then loses 3 marbles, so he has 22 - 3 = 19 marbles left.

Half of Doug's remaining marbles are given to Chris, so Doug has 19 / 2 = 9 marbles.

Therefore, Doug had 9 marbles initially.

Nine.","Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had initially as D.

According to the information given, Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had D + 5 marbles.

Doug lost 3 of his marbles, so he had D - 3 marbles left.

Then, Doug gave half of his remaining marbles to his friend Chris, so he gave (D - 3) / 2 marbles to Chris.

We know that after giving marbles to Chris, Doug had 27 marbles left. So we can write the equation:

D - 3 + (D - 3) / 2 = 27

Now, let's solve for D:

D - 3 + (D - 3) / 2 = 27
D - 3 + D / 2 - 3 / 2 = 27
D + D / 2 - 3 / 2 = 27
2D / 2 - 3 / 2 = 27
D - 3 = 27
D = 27 + 3
D = 30

So, Doug had initially 30 marbles.",Nine,30,22
416,"The grasshopper, the frog, the mouse, the kangaroo, and the rabbit had a jumping contest with a twist: they followed a specific jump sequence. Each animal took turns jumping, and the distance of their jump depended on the length of the previous jump and the previous animal's jump:

1. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches on its first jump.
2. The frog then jumped twice the distance of the grasshopper's jump.
3. The mouse jumped half the distance of the frog's jump.
4. The kangaroo jumped 3 times the distance of the mouse's jump.
5. The rabbit jumped 2.5 times the distance of the kangaroo's jump.

The sequence repeats in the same order (grasshopper, frog, mouse, kangaroo, rabbit) with the following patterns:
1. The grasshopper consistently increases its jump length by 10 inches.
2. The frog consistently decreases its jump length by 5 inches.
3. The mouse consistently alternates its jump by either a 3 inches or -2 inches change.
4. The kangaroo consistently doubles the distance of its previous jump.
5. The rabbit consistently reduces the multiplier by 0.5 after each jump. (e.g., 2.5, 2, 1.5, ...)

If each animal jumped 4 times, what was the distance of each animal's last jump?","Let's calculate the distance of each animal's last jump step by step, following the given sequence and patterns.

**First Jump:**
1. Grasshopper: 25 inches
2. Frog: 2 * 25 = 50 inches
3. Mouse: 50 / 2 = 25 inches
4. Kangaroo: 3 * 25 = 75 inches
5. Rabbit: 2.5 * 75 = 187.5 inches

**Second Jump:**
1. Grasshopper: 25 + 10 = 35 inches
2. Frog: 50 - 5 = 45 inches
3. Mouse: 25 + 3 = 28 inches (since it alternates, we add 3 inches this time)
4. Kangaroo: 75 * 2 = 150 inches
5. Rabbit: 2 * 150 = 300 inches (multiplier reduced by 0.5)

**Third Jump:**
1. Grasshopper: 35 + 10 = 45 inches
2. Frog: 45 - 5 = 40 inches
3. Mouse: 28 - 2 = 26 inches (alternating, we subtract 2 inches this time)
4. Kangaroo: 150 * 2 = 300 inches
5. Rabbit: 1.5 * 300 = 450 inches (multiplier reduced by 0.5)

**Fourth Jump:**
1. Grasshopper: 45 + 10 = 55 inches
2. Frog: 40 - 5 = 35 inches
3. Mouse: 26 + 3 = 29 inches (alternating, we add 3 inches this time)
4. Kangaroo: 300 * 2 = 600 inches
5. Rabbit: 1 * 600 = 600 inches (multiplier reduced by 0.5)

So, the distance of each animal's last jump is as follows:

Hop.","Let's calculate the distance of each animal's last jump based on the given jump sequence and patterns.

1. Grasshopper's last jump:
The grasshopper increases its jump length by 10 inches each time. Since it jumped 25 inches on its first jump, its last jump will be:
25 inches + (4 jumps * 10 inches) = 25 inches + 40 inches = 65 inches

2. Frog's last jump:
The frog decreases its jump length by 5 inches each time. Since it jumped twice the distance of the grasshopper's jump, its last jump will be:
2 * 25 inches = 50 inches
50 inches - (4 jumps * 5 inches) = 50 inches - 20 inches = 30 inches

3. Mouse's last jump:
The mouse alternates its jump by either a 3 inches or -2 inches change. Since it jumped half the distance of the frog's jump, its last jump will be:
(1/2) * 30 inches = 15 inches
15 inches + (4 jumps * 3 inches) = 15 inches + 12 inches = 27 inches

4. Kangaroo's last jump:
The kangaroo doubles the distance of its previous jump. Since it jumped 3 times the distance of the mouse's jump, its last jump will be:
3 * 27 inches = 81 inches

5. Rabbit's last jump:
The rabbit consistently reduces the multiplier by 0.5 after each jump. Since it jumped 2.5 times the distance of the kangaroo's jump, its last jump will be:
2.5 * 81 inches = 202.5 inches
202.5 inches * (1/2.5) = 81 inches

So, the distance of each animal's last jump is:
- Grasshopper: 65 inches
- Frog: 30 inches
- Mouse: 27 inches
- Kangaroo: 81 inches
- Rabbit: 81 inches",1287,81,600

Combined, Zachary and Sarah did 7 + 14 = 21 push-ups.","Let's first find out how many push-ups Zachary did. We know that David did 37 push-ups and did 30 more than Zachary, so Zachary did 37 - 30 = 7 push-ups. 
Sarah did twice as many as Zachary, so she did 2 x 7 = 14 push-ups.

Z = 37 - 30
Z = 7

So, Zachary did 7 push-ups.

Sarah completed twice as many push-ups as Zachary, so Sarah did 2 * Z = 2 * 7 = 14 push-ups.

Now, let's find the total number of push-ups Zachary and Sarah did combined:

418,"Frank was reading through his favorite book, which had 6 chapters with varying page lengths: Chapter 1 had 405 pages, Chapter 2 had 350 pages, Chapter 3 had 480 pages, Chapter 4 had 390 pages, and Chapter 5 had 520 pages, while Chapter 6 had only 200 pages. Frank's reading speed was 50 pages per hour. He took scheduled breaks every third day where he didn't read at all. It took Frank 34 days to finish the book. Calculate the effective amount of time (in hours) Frank spent reading each day, considering the days he read and the days he didn't.","First, let's calculate the total number of pages in the book by adding the pages of all the chapters together:

Chapter 1: 405 pages
Chapter 2: 350 pages
Chapter 3: 480 pages
Chapter 4: 390 pages
Chapter 5: 520 pages
Chapter 6: 200 pages

Total pages = 405 + 350 + 480 + 390 + 520 + 200
Total pages = 2345 pages

Now, we know Frank's reading speed is 50 pages per hour. To find out how many hours it took him to read the entire book, we divide the total number of pages by his reading speed:

Total hours = Total pages / Reading speed
Total hours = 2345 pages / 50 pages per hour
Total hours = 46.9 hours

Since Frank took breaks every third day, we need to find out how many days he actually spent reading. If he took 34 days to finish the book and took a break every third day, we can calculate the number of break days:

Break days = Total days / 3
Break days = 34 / 3
Break days ≈ 11 (since he can't take a fraction of a day as a break, we'll consider 11 full break days)

Now, we subtract the break days from the total days to find out the number of days he actually spent reading:

Reading days = Total days - Break days
Reading days = 34 - 11
Reading days = 23 days

Finally, we can calculate the effective amount of time Frank spent reading each day by dividing the total hours by the number of reading days:

Effective reading time per day = Total hours / Reading days
Effective reading time per day = 46.9 hours / 23 days
Effective reading time per day ≈ 2.04 hours per day

So, Frank spent approximately 2.04 hours reading each day on the days he read.","Frank read at a steady pace of 50 pages per hour. With scheduled breaks every third day, we can assume he read for two days and then took a day off. 

For the first two days, the total pages read would be 405 + 350 = 755 pages. At 50 pages per hour, this would take 755 / 50 = 15 hours.

For the next two days, he would read 480 + 390 = 870 pages, which equates to 870 / 50 = 17.4 hours. 

The fifth day would see him read 520 pages or 520 / 50 = 10.4 hours. 

On the sixth day, he took a break, and with the three-day pattern, the seventh and eighth days would also be break days. 

This cycle repeated twice more, which brings us to a total of 34 days, as mentioned in the scenario. 

So, the total effective reading time across the 34 days is the sum of the three two-day cycles: 

15 hours + 17.4 hours + 10.4 hours = 42.8 hours. 

The final result is 42.8 hours.","First, let's calculate the total number of pages in the book:

Total pages = Chapter 1 pages + Chapter 2 pages + Chapter 3 pages + Chapter 4 pages + Chapter 5 pages + Chapter 6 pages
Total pages = 405 + 350 + 480 + 390 + 520 + 200
Total pages = 2345 pages

Now, let's find out how many days Frank spent reading:

Days reading = Total pages / Frank's reading speed
Days reading = 2345 pages / 50 pages per hour
Days reading = 46.9 hours

Since Frank took scheduled breaks every third day, we need to find out how many days he spent reading and how many days he spent not reading.

Days reading = 46.9 hours / 24 hours per day
Days reading = 2.03 days

Now, let's find out how many days he spent not reading:

Days not reading = Total days - Days reading
Days not reading = 34 days - 2.03 days
Days not reading = 31.97 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round the days not reading to the nearest whole number. Since 31.97 is closer to 32 than 31, we'll consider it as 32 days.

Now, let's calculate the effective amount of time Frank spent reading each day, considering the days he read and the days he didn't:

Effective time reading per day = Days reading / Total days
Effective time reading per day = 2.03 days / 34 days
Effective time reading per day = 0.06 hours per day

So, Frank spent an effective amount of 0.06 hours reading each day.",42.8,0.06,2.04

Grade A:
Number of girls = 256
Number of boys = Number of girls - 52
Number of boys in Grade A = 256 - 52 = 204

Grade B:
Number of girls = 360
Number of boys = Number of girls - 40
Number of boys in Grade B = 360 - 40 = 320

Grade C:
Number of girls = 168
Number of boys = Number of girls (since it's equal)
Number of boys in Grade C = 168

Now, let's add up the number of boys from all three grade levels to find the total number of boys.

Total number of boys = Number of boys in Grade A + Number of boys in Grade B + Number of boys in Grade C

Total number of boys = 692

There are 692 boys in total across all three grade levels.","There are 556 boys in total across all three grades.

Grade A has 256 girls, and boys are in the minority, so we'll start there. If girls outnumber boys by 52, then there are 256 - 52 = 204 boys in Grade A.

Moving to Grade B, girls outnumber boys by 40 here. This means there are 360 - 40 = 320 boys in Grade B.

Grade C has an equal number of boys and girls, so there are 168 boys in this grade.

Adding up the boys from all three grades gives us 204 (Grade A) + 320 (Grade B) + 168 (Grade C) = 556 boys in total.

The final result is 556.","Let's start by finding out the number of boys in each grade level.

In Grade A, the number of girls is 52 more than the number of boys. So, if we let the number of boys in Grade A be B, then the number of girls is B + 52. We know that there are 256 girls in Grade A, so we can set up the equation:

B + 52 = 256

Now, we solve for B:

B = 256 - 52
B = 204

So, there are 204 boys in Grade A.

In Grade B, the number of boys is 40 less than the number of girls. If we let the number of boys in Grade B be B, then the number of girls is B + 40. We know that there are 360 girls in Grade B, so we can set up the equation:

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 126 / 0.5
x = 252 days

Now that we know Jessie jogged for 252 days, we can calculate her initial weight (W) before she started jogging. We know that after losing 126 kilograms, she weighs 66 kilograms. Therefore, her weight before jogging would be her current weight plus the weight she lost:

W = 66 + 126

After the first stop, 54 children got off and \( x_1 \) got on, so the number of children on the bus was \( 20 - 54 + x_1 \).

After the second stop, 30 children got off and \( x_2 \) got on, so the number of children on the bus was \( (20 - 54 + x_1) - 30 + x_2 \).

After the third stop, 15 children got off and \( x_3 \) got on, so the number of children on the bus was \( (20 - 54 + x_1 - 30 + x_2) - 15 + x_3 \).

We know that in the end, there were 35 children on the bus, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 20 - 54 + x_1 - 30 + x_2 - 15 + x_3 = 35 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ -79 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 35 \]

\[ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 35 + 79 \]

\[ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 114 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of children who got off the bus:

\[ 54 + 30 + 15 = 99 \]

The total number of children who got on the bus is \( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 114 \).

To find out how many more children got on the bus in total than those that got off, we subtract the total number who got off from the total number who got on:

\[ 114 - 99 = 15 \]

So, 15 more children got on the bus in total than those that got off during the entire bus ride.","There were 20 children to start with, and across the three stops, there were 54 + 30 + 15 children who got off the bus. That's 109 children who got off the bus in total.

We know that there were 35 children left on the bus in the end, so we can assume that the total number of children who got on the bus was 35 - 20 = 15 children. 

Considering the number of children who got off the bus during the entire ride is 109, the difference between these two figures is our required number:

15 - 109 = -94

**Negative ninety-four**.","Let's denote the number of children who got on the bus at each stop as \( x_1 \), \( x_2 \), and \( x_3 \), respectively.

At the first stop, 54 children got off the bus, so the number of children on the bus became \( 20 - 54 = -34 \). Since the number of children cannot be negative, we assume that some children got on the bus, so the number of children on the bus after the first stop became \( 20 - 54 + x_1 = x_1 \).

At the second stop, 30 children got off the bus, so the number of children on the bus became \( x_1 - 30 = x_1 - 30 \).

At the third stop, 15 children got off the bus, so the number of children on the bus became \( x_1 - 30 - 15 = x_1 - 45 \).

Finally, there were 35 children altogether on the bus, so the number of children on the bus after the third stop became \( x_1 - 45 = 35 \).

Now we have the equation \( x_1 - 45 = 35 \), which we can solve for \( x_1 \):

\( x_1 - 45 = 35 \)
\( x_1 = 35 + 45 \)
\( x_1 = 80 \)

So, 80 children got on the bus in total.

Now, let's find out how many more children got on the bus in total than those that got off during the entire bus ride.

The total number of children who got off the bus during the entire ride is \( 54 + 30 + 15 = 109 \).

The total number of children who got on the bus during the entire ride is \( x_1 = 80 \).

The difference between the number of children who got on the bus and the number of children who got off the bus is:

\( 80 - 109 = -29 \)

Since the number of children cannot be negative, we assume that some children got on the bus, so the number of children who got on the bus is \( 109 + 29 = 138 \).

Therefore, 138 more children got on the bus in total than those that got off during the entire bus ride.",negative ninety four,138,15
426,"On a school bus trip, 41 children were initially riding on the bus. At the first bus stop, 12 children got off while 5 got on. At the second bus stop, 7 children got off and 10 got on. At the third bus stop, 14 children got off and 3 got on. Finally, at the fourth bus stop, 9 children got off and 6 got on the bus. How many more children were on the bus before the first bus stop than at the final stop?","Let's calculate the number of children on the bus after each stop:

Initial number of children: 41

First bus stop: 41 - 12 (got off) + 5 (got on) = 34

Second bus stop: 34 - 7 (got off) + 10 (got on) = 37

Third bus stop: 37 - 14 (got off) + 3 (got on) = 26

Fourth bus stop: 26 - 9 (got off) + 6 (got on) = 23

Now, let's find out how many more children were on the bus before the first stop than at the final stop:

Initial number of children - Final number of children = 41 - 23 = 18

There were 18 more children on the bus before the first bus stop than at the final stop.","We begin with 41 children on the bus. At the first stop, this number changes to 41 - 12 + 5 = 34. After the second stop, we have 34 - 7 + 10 = 37 children. At the third stop, this number becomes 37 - 14 + 3 = 26. And finally, after the fourth stop, the number of children on the bus is 26 - 9 + 6 = 19. 

Therefore, there were 22 children more on the bus before the first bus stop than at the final stop.

The final result is: 22.","Before the first bus stop, there were 41 children on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 12 children got off, so there were 41 - 12 = 29 children left on the bus.

Then, 5 children got on, so there were 29 + 5 = 34 children on the bus.

At the second bus stop, 7 children got off, so there were 34 - 7 = 27 children left on the bus.

Then, 10 children got on, so there were 27 + 10 = 37 children on the bus.

At the third bus stop, 14 children got off, so there were 37 - 14 = 23 children left on the bus.

Then, 3 children got on, so there were 23 + 3 = 26 children on the bus.

At the fourth bus stop, 9 children got off, so there were 26 - 9 = 17 children left on the bus.

Then, 6 children got on, so there were 17 + 6 = 23 children on the bus.

To find out how many more children were on the bus before the first bus stop than at the final stop, we subtract the number of children at the final stop from the number of children before the first bus stop:

1. Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven.
2. Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill.
3. Lucy has twice the amount of peaches Jill has but 4 less than Jake's peaches.
4. Steven has 5 peaches.

From point 2, if Steven has 5 peaches and 8 more than Jill, then Jill has 5 - 8 = -3 peaches, which is not possible.

There might be a mistake in the initial conditions provided for the problem. Please check the information and try again.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know Steven has 5 + 8 = 13 peaches.

2. So, Jake has 13 - 3 = 10 peaches.

3. Then Jill has 13 - 8 = 5 peaches.

4. Lucy has 5 x 2 = 10 peaches.

5. But Lucy has 4 less than Jake, so Jake has 10 + 4 = 14 peaches.

6. Therefore, Jake has 14 - 5 = 9 more peaches than Jill.

Nine.","Let's denote the number of peaches Jill has as J.

According to the information given, Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, so Steven has J + 8 peaches.

We are told that Steven has 5 peaches, so we can set up the equation:

J + 8 = 5

Now, we can solve for J:

J = 5 - 8
J = -3

This doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of peaches. Let's go back and check our calculations.

We know that Steven has 5 peaches, and he has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, Steven has J + 8 peaches, and we just found out that J = 5 - 8, which is -3. This means Steven has 5 + 8 = 13 peaches.

Now, let's find out how many peaches Jill has. Since Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, we can say:

J = Steven's peaches - 8
J = 13 - 8
J = 5

So, Jill has 5 peaches.

Now, let's find out how many peaches Jake has. Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so:

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 3
Jake's peaches = 13 - 3
Jake's peaches = 10

Now, we can find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill:

Jake's peaches - Jill's peaches = 10 - 5
Jake's peaches - Jill's peaches = 5

The total number of soda bottles is 46 more than the total number of apples and oranges combined. The ratio of apples to oranges is 5:3, and there are 24 more apples than bananas. Write a system of equations to represent this situation and solve for all the variables (a, b, x, y, z).","Let's start by writing the equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of soda bottles is 46 more than the total number of apples and oranges combined:
   a + b = x + y + 46

2. The ratio of apples to oranges is 5:3:
   x/y = 5/3
   3x = 5y

3. There are 24 more apples than bananas:
   x = z + 24

Now we have a system of three equations with five variables. To solve for all the variables, we need two more equations. Since we don't have any additional information, we can't determine unique values for each variable. However, we can express some variables in terms of others.

Let's express 'y' and 'z' in terms of 'x' using equations 2 and 3:

From equation 2:
   3x = 5y
   y = (3/5)x

From equation 3:
   x = z + 24
   z = x - 24

Now we can substitute 'y' and 'z' back into equation 1 to express 'a' and 'b' in terms of 'x':

   a + b = x + (3/5)x + 46
   a + b = (8/5)x + 46

Since we don't have enough information to find the exact values of 'a' and 'b', we can express one in terms of the other and 'x':

   a = (8/5)x + 46 - b

Now we have expressions for 'y', 'z', and 'a' in terms of 'x' and 'b'. Without additional information, we can't solve for the exact values of the variables. If we had the total number of items or any other specific quantity, we could solve for the variables.","1. We set up two equations based on the given information:
a + b = 46 + (x + y)
x:y = 5:3

2. We can solve for x and y in the second equation by multiplying both sides by 6:
6x = 15y
x = 5/3 * y

3. Substituting this into the first equation gives us:
a + b = 46 + (5/3 * y + y)
4. This simplifies to:
a + b = 61 + 8/3 y

5. We now have a system of two equations:
x = 5/3 * y
a + b = 61 + 8/3 * y

6. We can solve this system by plugging in values. Let's start with y = 1. Then x would be 5. So the first equation becomes:
a + b = 61 + 8
7. Next, we'll manipulate the second equation to solve for b. Subtracting 61 from both sides leaves us with:
a + b - 61 = 8/3 * 1
a + b - 59 = 8/3
8. Multiplying both sides by 3 and solving for a gives:
a + b = 26 + 59
b = 85 - 26
b = 59

9. We can now plug in b=59 into the first equation to solve for a:
a + 59 = 61
a = 2

The final result: 2.","Let's denote the number of regular soda bottles as a, the number of diet soda bottles as b, the number of apples as x, the number of oranges as y, and the number of bananas as z.

According to the information given, the total number of soda bottles is 46 more than the total number of apples and oranges combined. This can be written as:
a + b = x + y + 46

The ratio of apples to oranges is 5:3, which can be written as:
x / y = 5 / 3

We are also told that there are 24 more apples than bananas, which can be written as:
x = z + 24

Now we have three equations:
1) a + b = x + y + 46
2) x / y = 5 / 3
3) x = z + 24

We can solve for the variables using these equations.

First, let's express y in terms of x using the second equation:
y = (3 / 5) * x

Now we can substitute y in the first equation:
a + b = x + ((3 / 5) * x) + 46

To simplify the equation, let's combine the terms with x:
a + b = x + (3 / 5) * x + 46
a + b = (4 / 5) * x + 46

Now we have a quadratic equation in terms of x:
a + b = (4 / 5) * x + 46

We can solve for x by rearranging the equation:
x = (5 / 4) * (a + b - 46)

Now we have an expression for x in terms of a and b. We can substitute this expression back into the third equation to solve for z:
x = z + 24
(5 / 4) * (a + b - 46) = z + 24

Now we have an equation for z in terms of a and b:
z = (5 / 4) * (a + b - 46) - 24

We have now solved for x and z in terms of a and b. We can use these expressions to solve for a and b.

Let's substitute the expression for x back into the first equation:
a + b = (4 / 5) * (a + b - 46) + 46

Let's assume that each small peach weighs ""x"" units. Therefore, each large peach weighs ""2x"" units since they are twice as heavy as the small ones.

For red peaches:
- Small red peaches: 7 small red peaches * x units each = 7x units
- Large red peaches: 5 large red peaches * 2x units each = 10x units
Total weight of red peaches = 7x + 10x = 17x units

For yellow peaches:
- Small yellow peaches: 71 small yellow peaches * x units each = 71x units
- Large yellow peaches: 14 large yellow peaches * 2x units each = 28x units
Total weight of yellow peaches = 71x + 28x = 99x units

For green peaches:
- Small green peaches: 8 small green peaches * x units each = 8x units
- Large green peaches: 11 large green peaches * 2x units each = 22x units
Total weight of green peaches = 8x + 22x = 30x units

Now, to find the difference in weight between green and red peaches:
Weight of green peaches - Weight of red peaches = 30x units - 17x units = 13x units

So, the difference in weight between green and red peaches is 13x units.","Let's solve this peach puzzle!

First, we tackle the red peaches. There are 7 small and 5 large ones. As large peaches weigh twice as small ones, the weight of small red peaches is 7 x 1 = 7 units. And the large red peaches weigh 5 x 2 = 10 units. So the total weight of red peaches is 7 + 10 = 17 units.

Now to the yellow peaches: 71 small and 14 large. Again, the large ones weigh twice as much as the small, so the weight of the small peaches is 71 x 1 = 71 units, and the large ones weigh 14 x 2 = 28 units. The total weight of yellow peaches is 71 + 28 = 99 units.

Lastly, the green peaches. There are 8 small and 11 large, so the weight of the small peaches is 8 x 1 = 8 units, and the large ones are 11 x 2 = 22 units. Their total weight is 8 + 22 = 30 units. 

Now for the final step: finding the difference between green and red peaches. We subtract the weight of green peaches from the weight of red peaches: 30 - 17 = 13.
 
The result: **13**.","First, let's calculate the total weight of each color of peaches separately:

- Red peaches:
   - Small red peaches: 7 * 2 (since large peaches weigh twice as much as small peaches) = 14
   - Large red peaches: 5 * 2 = 10
   - Total weight of red peaches: 14 + 10 = 24

- Yellow peaches:
   - Small yellow peaches: 71 * 2 = 142
   - Large yellow peaches: 14 * 2 = 28

- Green peaches:
   - Small green peaches: 8 * 2 = 16
   - Large green peaches: 11 * 2 = 22
   - Total weight of green peaches: 16 + 22 = 38

According to the information given, Ben brought B balloons, where B = A + 6.

Carla brought twice as many balloons as Allan, so she brought 2A balloons. She also brought half as many balloons as Ben, so she brought B/2 balloons.

Since B = A + 6, we can substitute B with A + 6 in the equation for Carla's balloons:

Carla's balloons = B/2 = (A + 6)/2

Now we have two expressions for the number of balloons Carla brought: 2A and (A + 6)/2. Since both expressions represent the same quantity (the number of balloons Carla brought), we can set them equal to each other:

2A = (A + 6)/2

To solve for A, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

4A = A + 6

Now, we subtract A from both sides to isolate the variable:

4A - A = A + 6 - A

3A = 6

Therefore, Carla brought 4 balloons to the park.

The result is four.","If Ben brought B balloons and B = A + 6, then Allan brought A balloons.

Carla brought twice as many balloons as Allan, so Carla brought 2A balloons.

Carla also brought half as many balloons as Ben, so Carla brought B/2 balloons.

Since B = A + 6, we can substitute B with A + 6 in the expression B/2:

(A + 6)/2 = A/2 + 3/2

To solve for A, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions A/2 and 3/2, which is 2A.

So, we have:

(A + 6)/2 = (A/2 + 3/2)

Now, we multiply both sides by 2A to get rid of the fractions:

A + 6 = A + 3

Now, we subtract A from both sides to get rid of the A term:

6 = 3

This is not a true statement, so there must be a mistake in the given information. If Ben brought B balloons and B = A + 6, then Allan brought A balloons, and Carla brought twice as many balloons as Allan, so Carla brought 2A balloons.

However, Carla also brought half as many balloons as Ben, so Carla brought B/2 balloons.

Since B = A + 6, we can substitute B with A + 6 in the expression B/2:

It was a special day, as it was one of the 14 holiday events over the past 327 days, which tend to see double the average number of daily visitors. The total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 327 days was 406. If the average number of visitors per non-holiday day is x, find the value of x and determine the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on the day before the special holiday event.","Let's denote the average number of visitors per non-holiday day as x. Since there are 327 days in total and 14 of those are holiday events, there are 327 - 14 = 313 non-holiday days.

On holiday events, the number of visitors is double the average of non-holiday days, so each holiday event brings in 2x visitors.

The total number of visitors over the 327 days is the sum of visitors on non-holiday days and visitors on holiday days. We can express this as:

313x (visitors on non-holiday days) + 14(2x) (visitors on holiday days) = 406 (total visitors)

Now, let's solve for x:

313x + 28x = 406
341x = 406
x = 406 / 341
x = 1.190616 (approximately)

Since we're dealing with visitors, we should round to the nearest whole number because we can't have a fraction of a visitor. Therefore, x ≈ 1 visitor per non-holiday day.

Now, to find the number of visitors who visited Buckingham Palace on the day before the special holiday event, we use the average number of visitors on a non-holiday day, which is 1 visitor.

So, the number of visitors on the day before the special holiday event would be 1 visitor.","Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. We know that on the special holiday, twice the average number of visitors visited the palace, and the total number of visitors over 327 days was 406. We can write this as:

2x = 132 + 406
2x = 538
x = 269 (visitors/day)

2. Now, if we assume the holiday was the last day in the 327-day period, then the number of visitors on the day before the holiday would be:

x visitors/day × 326 days = 87,092 visitors

However, if we don't know where the holiday falls within the 327-day period, we can't determine the number of visitors on the day before the holiday.

The average number of visitors per non-holiday day is 269 visitors, and the number of visitors on the day before the holiday is either 269 or undeterminable depending on the context.

**269 or ?**","Let's denote the average number of visitors per non-holiday day as x.

According to the information given, on the special holiday event, the number of visitors doubled the average number of daily visitors. So, the number of visitors on the holiday event was 2x.

The total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 327 days was 406. This includes the visitors on the holiday event. Therefore, the number of visitors on the holiday event is:

406 (total visitors) - x (average visitors per non-holiday day) = 2x (visitors on holiday event)

Now, we can solve for x:

406 - x = 2x
406 = 3x
x = 406 / 3
x = 135.33 (approximately)

Since the average number of visitors per non-holiday day is approximately 135.33, we can find the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on the day before the special holiday event by multiplying the average number of visitors per non-holiday day by the number of non-holiday days in the past 327 days.

There are 327 - 14 = 313 non-holiday days in the past 327 days.

So, the number of visitors on the day before the special holiday event is:

x * 313 = 135.33 * 313
x * 313 = 42400.29 (approximately)

Since the number of visitors on the day before the special holiday event cannot be a fraction, we can round the number to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on the day before the special holiday event is approximately 42,400.",269 or ?,"42,400",1
433,"In a basket containing a total of 'p' fruits, there are 'r' red peaches and the rest are green peaches. If the sum of the number of red peaches and twice the number of green peaches is 3 more than the total number of fruits, express the number of green peaches in terms of 'p' and 'r'.","Let's denote the number of green peaches as 'g'. According to the problem, the total number of fruits 'p' is the sum of the number of red peaches 'r' and the number of green peaches 'g'. So we can write:

p = r + g  (1)

We are also given that the sum of the number of red peaches and twice the number of green peaches is 3 more than the total number of fruits. This can be expressed as:

r + 2g = p + 3  (2)

Now, we want to express 'g' in terms of 'p' and 'r'. We can use equation (1) to express 'g' in terms of 'p' and 'r':

g = p - r  (3)

Now, we substitute equation (3) into equation (2) to solve for 'g':

r + 2(p - r) = p + 3
r + 2p - 2r = p + 3
2p - r = p + 3
2p - p = r + 3
p = r + 3

Now, we substitute this back into equation (3):

g = p - r
g = (r + 3) - r
g = 3

So, the number of green peaches 'g' is 3, regardless of the values of 'p' and 'r'.","We're asked to find the number of green peaches in a basket where there are 'r' red peaches and the rest are green peaches. We're also given that the sum of 'r' and twice the number of green peaches is three more than the total number of fruits in the basket.

We can represent the total number of fruits with 'p'. So, we have:
r + 2 * (p - r) = p + 3

Simplifying this equation, we get:
r + 2p - 2r = p + 3

Combining like terms:
p = 5 - r

Now, we can determine that the number of green peaches is given by half of the difference between the total number of fruits and the number of red peaches, which is:
(p - r) = (5 - 3r)/2

Therefore, the number of green peaches is:
(5 - 3r)/4

Green Peaches: (5 - 3r)/4","Let's denote the number of green peaches as \( G \). According to the problem, we have:

\[ r + 2G = p + 3 \]

We are given that \( p \) is the total number of fruits and \( r \) is the number of red peaches. So we can express \( G \) in terms of \( p \) and \( r \) as follows:

\[ G = \frac{p + 3 - r}{2} \]

Now, let's simplify the expression:

\[ G = \frac{p + 3}{2} - \frac{r}{2} \]

Since \( p \) is the total number of fruits, we can express \( r \) as a fraction of \( p \):

\[ r = \frac{r}{p} \times p \]

Now, let's substitute \( r \) in the expression for \( G \):

\[ G = \frac{p + 3}{2} - \frac{\frac{r}{p} \times p}{2} \]

\[ G = \frac{p + 3}{2} - \frac{r}{2p} \times p \]

\[ G = \frac{p + 3}{2} - \frac{r}{2} \]

Now, let's solve for \( G \):

\[ G = \frac{p + 3}{2} - \frac{r}{2} \]
\[ G = \frac{p + 3}{2} - \frac{p}{2} \times \frac{r}{p} \]
\[ G = \frac{p + 3}{2} - \frac{pr}{2p} \]
\[ G = \frac{p + 3}{2} - \frac{r}{2} \]

This expression matches the one we started with, so we have correctly expressed the number of green peaches in terms of \( p \) and \( r \).",(5 - 3r)/4,**\frac{p + 3}{2} - \frac{r}{2}**,3

1. Eggs: Rebecca has 75 eggs and wants to split them into groups of 4.
   75 ÷ 4 = 18 groups with a remainder of 3 eggs.

2. Bananas: Rebecca has 99 bananas and wants to split them into groups of 5.
   99 ÷ 5 = 19 groups with a remainder of 4 bananas.

3. Marbles: Rebecca has 48 marbles and wants to split them into groups of 6.
   48 ÷ 6 = 8 groups with no remainder.

4. Apples: Rebecca has 6 dozen apples, which means she has 6 x 12 = 72 apples. She wants to split them into dozen groups.
   72 ÷ 12 = 6 groups with no remainder.

5. Oranges: Rebecca has half a dozen oranges, which means she has 0.5 x 12 = 6 oranges. She wants to split them into pairs.

Now, let's add up the number of groups for each item:
Egg groups: 18
Banana groups: 19
Marble groups: 8
Apple groups: 6
Orange groups: 3

Total number of groups = 18 + 19 + 8 + 6 + 3 = 54 groups.

Rebecca will create 54 groups in total.","Rebecca has:

- 99 bananas, divided by 5 bananas/group = 19.8 groups
- 48 marbles, divided by 6 marbles/group = 8 groups
- 6 dozen apples, divided by 12 apples/dozen = 5 groups
- 0.5 dozen oranges, divided by 2 oranges/half dozen = 0.25 groups

The maximum number of groups needed is 19.8, which we will round up to 20 groups.

**20**","Let's calculate the number of groups for each item:

1. Eggs: Rebecca has 75 eggs. She wants to put them in groups of 4, so we divide 75 by 4:

   Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll need to adjust the number of eggs per group. Let's make it 3 eggs per group:
   75 eggs ÷ 3 eggs/group = 25 groups

2. Bananas: Rebecca has 99 bananas. She wants to put them in groups of 5, so we divide 99 by 5:
   99 bananas ÷ 5 bananas/group = 19.8 groups
   Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll need to adjust the number of bananas per group. Let's make it 4 bananas per group:
   99 bananas ÷ 4 bananas/group = 24.75 groups
   Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll need to adjust the number of bananas per group. Let's make it 5 bananas per group:
   99 bananas ÷ 5 bananas/group = 19.8 groups
   Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll need to adjust the number of bananas per group. Let's make it 6 bananas per group:
   99 bananas ÷ 6 bananas/group = 16.5 groups
   Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll need to adjust the number of bananas per group. Let's make it 7 bananas per group:
   99 bananas ÷ 7 bananas/group = 14 groups

3. Marbles: Rebecca has 48 marbles. She wants to put them in groups of 6, so we divide 48 by 6:
   48 marbles ÷ 6 marbles/group = 8 groups

4. Apples: Rebecca has 6 dozen apples. A dozen is 12, so she has 6 * 12 = 72 apples. She wants to put them in dozen groups, so we divide 72 by 12:
   72 apples ÷ 12 apples/group = 6 groups

5. Oranges: Rebecca has half a dozen oranges. A dozen is 12, so she has 12 / 2 = 6 oranges. She wants to put them in pair groups, so we divide 6 by 2:

437,"Paul received a large box of crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year, he had 2,560 crayons left. He had lost twice as many crayons as he had given away to his friends. In total, he lost or gave away 9,750 crayons. How many crayons did Paul receive for his birthday?","Let's denote the number of crayons Paul gave away as G and the number of crayons he lost as L. According to the information given:

L = 2G (He lost twice as many as he gave away)

We also know that the total number of crayons he lost or gave away is 9,750:

L + G = 9,750

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2G + G = 9,750
3G = 9,750
G = 9,750 / 3
G = 3,250 (Number of crayons Paul gave away)

Now we can find out how many he lost by using the first equation:

L = 2G
L = 2 * 3,250
L = 6,500 (Number of crayons Paul lost)

Now we know how many crayons Paul had left and how many he lost or gave away, so we can find out how many he received for his birthday by adding the crayons he had left to the ones he lost or gave away:

Crayons received = Crayons left + Crayons lost + Crayons given away
Crayons received = 2,560 + 6,500 + 3,250
Crayons received = 12,310

So, Paul received 12,310 crayons for his birthday.","Paul's crayon count didn't change after receiving them, so we'll call this initial amount X. 
We know that X - (2 × GivenAway) = 2560.
The amount of crayons lost or given away is equal to 9750, so the amount given away is 9750 / 2 = 4875.
Substituting this into the first equation, we get X - 9750 = 2560.
Therefore, X = 12,310.

**12310**","Let's denote the number of crayons Paul received for his birthday as \( C \).

According to the information given, Paul lost twice as many crayons as he had given away to his friends. This means that for every crayon he gave away, he lost two crayons. So, if he gave away \( x \) crayons, he lost \( 2x \) crayons.

The total number of crayons Paul lost or gave away is 9,750, which can be represented as \( L \). Therefore, we have the equation:

\( L = x + 2x \)

Combining like terms, we get:

\( L = 3x \)

We know that Paul had 2,560 crayons left by the end of the school year, which can be represented as \( R \). So, we have the equation:

\( R = C - L \)

Substituting the value of \( L \) we found into the equation, we get:

\( R = C - 3x \)

We know that \( R = 2,560 \), so we can substitute this value into the equation:

\( 2,560 = C - 3x \)

Now, we need to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true. Since we don't have any information about the number of crayons Paul gave away, we can't solve for \( x \) directly. However, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( x \) and then solve for \( C \).

From the equation \( L = 3x \), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( L \):

\( x = \frac{L}{3} \)

Now, we can substitute this expression for \( x \) into the equation for \( C \):

\( C = 2,560 - 3 \left( \frac{L}{3} \right) \)

Substituting the value of \( L \) we found into the equation, we get:

\( C = 2,560 - 3 \left( \frac{9,750}{3} \right) \)

\( C = 2,560 - 3 \times 3,250 \)

\( C = 2,560 - 9,750 \)

\( C = -7,190 \)

First, let's find out how many pies the chef can make with the apples he has left. He has 39 apples left, and for each apple, he uses 2 peaches, 3 pears, and 4 plums.

Number of pies = 39 apples / (2 peaches per apple + 3 pears per apple + 4 plums per apple)
Number of pies = 39 / (2 + 3 + 4)
Number of pies = 39 / 9
Number of pies = 4

Now, let's calculate the total amount of each fruit used in the pies.

Total peaches used = 2 peaches per apple * 4 apples per pie * 4 pies
Total peaches used = 2 * 4 * 4
Total peaches used = 32

Total pears used = 3 pears per apple * 4 apples per pie * 4 pies
Total pears used = 3 * 4 * 4
Total pears used = 48

Total plums used = 4 plums per apple * 4 apples per pie * 4 pies
Total plums used = 4 * 4 * 4

Net earnings = Total earnings - Expenses
Net earnings = $165 - $40
Net earnings = $125

Now, we need to express the daily earnings in terms of the variables given for each day. Let's denote the daily earnings as E1, E2, E3, E4, and E5 for days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

We have the following equations based on the information provided:

E1 = x (earnings on day 1 when the cost to play was $1)
E2 = y (earnings on day 2 when the cost to play was $2)
E3 = z (earnings on day 3 when the cost to play was $3)
E4 = w (earnings on day 4 when the cost to play was $4)
E5 = v (earnings on day 5 when the cost to play was $5)

Day 3 earnings = $z
Day 4 earnings = $w
Day 5 earnings = $v

The total earnings over the 5 days are given as $165, and the expenses for maintaining the game are $40.

So, the total earnings minus the expenses gives us the net earnings:

Net earnings = Total earnings - Expenses
Net earnings = $165 - $40
Net earnings = $125

Now, let's set up the equations for each day based on the information given:

Day 1: Cost to play = $1, earnings = $x
1x = Cost to play * Earnings
1x = $1 * $x
x = $1

Day 2: Cost to play = $2, earnings = $y
2y = Cost to play * Earnings
2y = $2 * $y
y = $1

3z = Cost to play * Earnings
3z = $3 * $z
z = $1

Day 4: Cost to play = $4, earnings = $w
4w = Cost to play * Earnings
4w = $4 * $w
w = $1

Day 5: Cost to play = $5, earnings = $v
5v = Cost to play * Earnings
5v = $5 * $v
v = $1

The total number of apples remaining on all three trees is 9, so we can write the following equation:

(A - 8) + (B - 12) + (C - 15) = 9

Now, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms:

A + B + C - 8 - 12 - 15 = 9
A + B + C - 35 = 9

To find the initial number of apples on each tree, we need to add 35 to both sides of the equation to isolate A + B + C:

A + B + C = 9 + 35
A + B + C = 44

So, initially, there were a total of 44 apples on all three trees. However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of apples on each individual tree (A, B, and C) because there are multiple combinations of A, B, and C that could add up to 44. We would need additional information to solve for the individual values of A, B, and C.","Let's solve the problem step by step:
1. Start with the third tree, we picked 15 apples, and now there are 9 apples left, which means the tree initially had 15 + 9 = 24 apples.

2. For the second tree, we picked 12 apples, and there are 9 left on the tree, so it initially had 12 + 9 = 21 apples.

3. Similarly, for the first tree, the initial number of apples is 8 + 9 = 17.

So, the initial count of apples on each tree is 17, 21, and 24.

The final result is 17.","Let's denote the initial number of apples on the first tree as A, on the second tree as B, and on the third tree as C.

Rachel picked 8 apples from the first tree, so the number of apples left on the first tree is A - 8.
She picked 12 apples from the second tree, so the number of apples left on the second tree is B - 12.
She picked 15 apples from the third tree, so the number of apples left on the third tree is C - 15.

According to the information given, the total number of apples left on all three trees is 9. So we can write the equation:

A - 8 + B - 12 + C - 15 = 9

Now, let's add the terms together:

A - 8 + B - 12 + C - 15 = A - 8 + B - 12 + C - 15
A - 8 + B - 12 + C - 15 = A + B + C - 35

Since we don't have the individual values for A, B, and C, we can't solve for them directly. However, we can express the total number of apples initially on all three trees as A + B + C.

Let's assume the total number of apples initially on all three trees is T. Then we can write:

A + B + C = T

Now, we can substitute the expression for A + B + C - 35 into the equation for the total number of apples left:

(A + B + C) - 35 = 9

Substitute the expression for A + B + C into the equation:

T - 35 = 9

Now, we can solve for T:

T = 9 + 35
T = 44

So, the total number of apples initially on all three trees was 44. Since we don't have the individual values for A, B, and C, we can't determine how many apples were on each tree initially. We need more information to solve for A, B, and C.",17,44,44

444,"At the zoo, a cage had 95 snakes divided into two species. 55 of them were green pythons and the rest were red vipers. The cage also housed 61 alligators. If 64 snakes were hiding and 32 of them were green pythons, what proportion of each snake species were not hiding?","Let's start by determining the number of red vipers in the cage. Since there are 95 snakes in total and 55 of them are green pythons, we can subtract the number of green pythons from the total number of snakes to find the number of red vipers:

Number of red vipers = Total number of snakes - Number of green pythons
Number of red vipers = 95 - 55
Number of red vipers = 40

Now, we know that 64 snakes were hiding, and 32 of them were green pythons. To find out how many green pythons were not hiding, we subtract the number of hiding green pythons from the total number of green pythons:

Green pythons not hiding = Total green pythons - Hiding green pythons
Green pythons not hiding = 55 - 32
Green pythons not hiding = 23

Since 64 snakes were hiding in total and 32 of them were green pythons, the remaining hiding snakes must be red vipers:

Hiding red vipers = Total hiding snakes - Hiding green pythons
Hiding red vipers = 64 - 32
Hiding red vipers = 32

Now, we can find out how many red vipers were not hiding by subtracting the number of hiding red vipers from the total number of red vipers:

Red vipers not hiding = Total red vipers - Hiding red vipers
Red vipers not hiding = 40 - 32
Red vipers not hiding = 8

Finally, we can calculate the proportion of each snake species that were not hiding:

Proportion of green pythons not hiding = Green pythons not hiding / Total green pythons
Proportion of green pythons not hiding = 23 / 55

Proportion of red vipers not hiding = Red vipers not hiding / Total red vipers
Proportion of red vipers not hiding = 8 / 40

To express these proportions as percentages, we multiply by 100:

Percentage of green pythons not hiding = (23 / 55) * 100
Percentage of green pythons not hiding ≈ 41.82%

Percentage of red vipers not hiding = (8 / 40) * 100
Percentage of red vipers not hiding = 20%

So, approximately 41.82% of the green pythons and 20% of the red vipers were not hiding.","To solve the problem, we need to find the number of snakes that were not hiding for each species. We know that:
- The total number of snakes is 95.
- 55 are green pythons.
- 40 are red vipers (95 - 55 = 40).

We're also given that 64 snakes are hiding, and 32 of them are green pythons:
- This means that 32 red vipers are also hiding (64 - 32 = 32).

Now, we can find the number of snakes not hiding by subtracting the number of snakes hiding from the total number of snakes for each species:
- Green pythons: 55 - 32 = 23
- Red vipers: 40 - 32 = 8

Therefore, the proportion of snakes not hiding for each species is:
- Green pythons: 23 / 95 × 100% = 24%
- Red vipers: 8 / 95 × 100% = 8.4%

The final result is 24% + 8.4% = 32.4%. 

**32.4%**","First, let's find out how many red vipers were not hiding. Since we know that 55 green pythons were not hiding and 32 green pythons were hiding, we can subtract the number of green pythons not hiding from the total number of snakes to find the number of red vipers not hiding.

95 snakes (total) - 55 green pythons (not hiding) = 40 red vipers (not hiding)

Now, let's find out the total number of snakes that were not hiding.

95 snakes (total) - 64 snakes (hiding) = 31 snakes (not hiding)

Since we know that 40 red vipers were not hiding, we can subtract that number from the total number of snakes not hiding to find the number of green pythons not hiding.

31 snakes (not hiding) - 40 red vipers (not hiding) = 11 green pythons (not hiding)

Now, let's find the proportion of each snake species that were not hiding.

Proportion of green pythons not hiding = 11 green pythons (not hiding) / 55 green pythons (total) = 0.2

Proportion of red vipers not hiding = 40 red vipers (not hiding) / 55 red vipers (total) = 0.727

Since we are looking for the proportion of each snake species that were not hiding, we can add the two proportions together.

Proportion of snakes not hiding = 0.2 (green pythons) + 0.727 (red vipers) = 0.927

She has 5 minutes to create as many groups as possible. How many groups can be created within these constraints?","To create a group of 4 marbles with 2 blue marbles and 2 red marbles, we need to consider the number of blue and red marbles Rebecca has.

Rebecca has 12 blue marbles and 18 red marbles. Since each group requires 2 blue marbles, the number of groups that can be created is limited by the number of blue marbles she has. With 12 blue marbles, she can create 12 / 2 = 6 groups of blue marbles.

However, we also need to consider the red marbles. Each group requires 2 red marbles, and with 18 red marbles, she could create 18 / 2 = 9 groups of red marbles.

The limiting factor here is the number of blue marbles since she can only create 6 groups with the blue marbles she has.

(Assume 1 kg = 2.205 lb),"First, let's calculate how much more flour Mary needs to add. She has already put in 1 kg of flour, and the recipe calls for 2.25 kg. So, she needs to add:

2.25 kg - 1 kg = 1.25 kg of flour

Now, let's convert the remaining flour needed into grams, knowing that 1 kg is equal to 1000 grams:

1.25 kg * 1000 g/kg = 1250 g of flour

Next, we need to convert the sugar needed from pounds to grams. The recipe calls for 5.5 lb of sugar. We know that 1 kg is equal to 2.205 lb, so to find out how many kilograms are in 5.5 lb, we divide the pounds by the conversion factor:

5.5 lb / 2.205 lb/kg = 2.4948 kg (approximately)

Now, let's convert the sugar needed into grams:

2.4948 kg * 1000 g/kg = 2494.8 g of sugar

Finally, let's find out how many more grams of sugar than grams of flour Mary needs to add:

2494.8 g of sugar - 1250 g of flour = 1244.8 g more sugar than flour

Result: 945.","First, let's convert the amount of sugar Mary needs to grams. Since 1 kg = 2.205 lb, we can convert 5.5 lb of sugar to grams:

There are now 91 orchids, 22 roses, and 101 tulips in the vase. How many roses and tulips did she cut?","Let's calculate the difference in the number of roses, orchids, and tulips before and after Jessica cut more flowers from her garden.

Originally, there were 13 roses, and now there are 22 roses. So, Jessica cut:
22 roses - 13 roses = 9 roses

Originally, there were 84 orchids, and now there are 91 orchids. So, Jessica cut:
91 orchids - 84 orchids = 7 orchids

Originally, there were 65 tulips, and now there are 101 tulips. So, Jessica cut:
101 tulips - 65 tulips = 36 tulips

Now, according to the information given, for each rose Jessica cut, she also cut two tulips. Since she cut 9 roses, she would have cut:
9 roses * 2 tulips/rose = 18 tulips

However, we calculated that she actually added 36 tulips to the vase. This means that she cut an additional number of tulips independently of the roses. To find out how many additional tulips she cut, we subtract the tulips cut due to roses from the total tulips added:
36 tulips - 18 tulips = 18 additional tulips

So, Jessica cut 9 roses and 36 tulips in total.","Let's solve this problem step by step. We will start with the given information and work our way towards the number of roses and tulips cut.

We know the initial quantities of flowers:
• Roses = 22 + x
• Orchids = 91 + y
• Tulips = 101 + 2x

We also know that the ratio of tulips to roses is 2:1, which means x and 2x tulips were cut for each rose cut.

Equating the initial and final quantities yields:
• 13 + x = 22 + x (roses)
• This means x = 9

Similarly,
• 65 + 2x = 101 + 2x
Which also gives x = 9

So the number of roses cut is 9 and this means that twice as many tulips were cut, which gives us 18 tulips. 

The final answer is 27.","Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut as R and the number of tulips she cut as T.

From the information given, we know that after cutting the roses and orchids, there were 91 orchids left, which is 84 - R.

We are told that there are now 22 roses and 101 tulips in the vase. So, the number of roses she cut is 13 - 22 = -9 roses (which is not possible).

451,"Ed originally had 3 times as many marbles as Doug. After purchasing x marbles and losing 21 at the playground, he ended up with 91 marbles. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug after these events?","Let's denote the number of marbles Doug originally had as D. According to the information given, Ed originally had 3 times as many marbles as Doug, so Ed had 3D marbles.

After purchasing x marbles and losing 21, Ed ended up with 91 marbles. We can express this with the following equation:

3D + x - 21 = 91

Now we need to solve for D in terms of x:

3D + x = 91 + 21
3D + x = 112
3D = 112 - x
D = (112 - x) / 3

Now, we want to find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug after these events. Since Ed ended up with 91 marbles and Doug originally had D marbles, we need to find the difference between Ed's final count and Doug's original count:

More marbles Ed had than Doug = 91 - D
More marbles Ed had than Doug = 91 - (112 - x) / 3

To simplify this, we can multiply out the denominator:

More marbles Ed had than Doug = 91 - (112/3) + (x/3)
More marbles Ed had than Doug = (273/3) - (112/3) + (x/3)
More marbles Ed had than Doug = (273 - 112 + x) / 3
More marbles Ed had than Doug = (161 + x) / 3

So, Ed had (161 + x) / 3 more marbles than Doug after purchasing x marbles and losing 21 at the playground.","Let's solve this problem step by step:
1. We know that originally Ed had 3 times as many marbles as Doug, which means Ed had 3 * x = 3x marbles, where x is Doug's amount of marbles.

2. After some time, Ed bought x marbles, so he had 3x + x = 4x marbles.

3. Then, Ed lost 21 marbles, leaving him with 4x - 21 marbles.

4. We're told that eventually, Ed ended up with 91 marbles, so we can say 4x - 21 = 91. 

5. Adding 21 to both sides, we get 4x = 112. 

6. Finally, dividing by 4, we find that x = 28, which is the amount of marbles Doug has.

7. Now, we can calculate the difference in marbles between Ed and Doug: 3x - x = 2x.

The final result: 
**28**
marbles.","Let's denote the number of marbles Doug has as D. According to the information given, Ed originally had 3 times as many marbles as Doug, so Ed had 3D marbles.

After purchasing x marbles, Ed's total number of marbles became 3D + x. Then, he lost 21 marbles, so his new total became (3D + x) - 21.

We are told that after these events, Ed ended up with 91 marbles, so we can set up the equation:

(3D + x) - 21 = 91

Now, let's solve for x:

3D + x = 91 + 21
3D + x = 112

Since we don't know the value of D, we can't solve for x directly. However, we can express x in terms of D:

x = 112 - 3D

Now, let's find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug after these events. We know that originally, Ed had 3 times as many marbles as Doug, so:

Ed's original number of marbles = 3D

After purchasing x marbles and losing 21, Ed's new number of marbles became:

Ed's new number of marbles = (3D + x) - 21

Substitute the expression for x we found into the equation:

Ed's new number of marbles = (3D + (112 - 3D)) - 21
Ed's new number of marbles = (3D + 112 - 3D) - 21
Ed's new number of marbles = 112 - 21
Ed's new number of marbles = 91

This matches the given information that Ed ended up with 91 marbles. Now, let's find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug after these events:

Ed's new number of marbles = 91
Doug's new number of marbles = D

The difference is:

452,Baker initially made 110 cakes. He sold 40% of them. Then he baked 5/8 more cakes than the remaining cakes. How many cakes would Baker still have after making the new batch of cakes?,"First, let's find out how many cakes Baker sold. He sold 40% of the initial 110 cakes. 

40% of 110 cakes = 0.40 * 110 = 44 cakes

So, he sold 44 cakes. Now let's find out how many cakes he had left after the sale.

110 cakes - 44 cakes = 66 cakes remaining

Next, Baker baked 5/8 more cakes than the remaining cakes. To find out how many that is, we calculate 5/8 of the remaining 66 cakes.

5/8 of 66 cakes = (5/8) * 66 = 5 * 8.25 = 41.25

Since Baker can't bake a fraction of a cake, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, he baked 41 more cakes.

Now, let's add the new batch of cakes to the remaining cakes to find out how many cakes Baker would have in total.

66 cakes + 41 cakes = 107 cakes

After making the new batch of cakes, Baker would have 107 cakes.","Baker had 110 x 40% = 44 cakes left after selling 40% of his cakes.
Then Baker baked 5/8 x 44 = 22 new cakes.
So Baker would have a total of 44 + 22 = 66 cakes. 

Sixty-six.","First, let's find out how many cakes Baker sold:

40% of 110 cakes = 0.40 * 110 = 44 cakes

110 cakes - 44 cakes = 66 cakes

Next, we need to find out how many more cakes Baker baked:

5/8 of 66 cakes = (5/8) * 66 = 37.5 cakes

Since Baker can't bake a fraction of a cake, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 37 cakes.

Now, let's add the new cakes to the remaining cakes:

453,"Mary is baking a cake. The original recipe calls for 2.5 cups of flour and 3.75 cups of sugar, but she wants to double the recipe. She already put in 4 cups of flour and 4.5 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add?","If Mary wants to double the original recipe, she needs to double the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour, the original recipe calls for 2.5 cups, so doubled would be 2.5 cups x 2 = 5 cups. Mary has already put in 4 cups of flour, so she doesn't need to add any more flour because she has put in less than required.

For sugar, the original recipe calls for 3.75 cups, so doubled would be 3.75 cups x 2 = 7.5 cups. Mary has already put in 4.5 cups of sugar.

To find out how much more sugar she needs to add, we subtract the amount she has already put in from the total amount she needs:

7.5 cups (needed) - 4.5 cups (already added) = 3 cups

Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar to the recipe.","Mary has already added more flour and sugar than what the doubled recipe calls for. She put in 4 cups of flour, while the recipe calls for 5 cups of flour. She should take out 1 cup of flour.

For the sugar, the recipe requires 7.5 cups of sugar in total, and Mary already added 4.5 cups, so she needs to add another 3 cups of sugar. 

The result is 3.","To find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we first need to calculate the total amount of sugar she would have if she doubled the recipe.

The original recipe calls for 3.75 cups of sugar, and she wants to double that, so:

3.75 cups (original sugar amount) * 2 (doubled) = 7.5 cups (doubled sugar amount)

Now, let's subtract the amount of sugar she has already put in from the doubled sugar amount to find out how much more she needs:

7.5 cups (doubled sugar amount) - 4.5 cups (sugar already added) = 3 cups (more sugar needed)

If she needs to maintain a daily intake where for every 3 soda bottles she drinks, she must also consume 2 water bottles, how many days would the soda bottles last if she maintains this fixed ratio every day?","To maintain the fixed ratio of 3 soda bottles to 2 water bottles, we need to find out how many sets of this ratio Debby can make with the bottles she bought.

For every set of 3 soda bottles, there are 2 water bottles. So, the number of sets is limited by the type of bottle that runs out first.

Let's find out how many sets of the ratio Debby can make with the water bottles since they are fewer in number:

162 water bottles / 2 water bottles per set = 81 sets

Now, let's check if she has enough soda bottles to maintain this ratio for 81 sets:

81 sets * 3 soda bottles per set = 243 soda bottles

Debby bought 360 soda bottles, which is more than the 243 soda bottles needed for the 81 sets. Therefore, she has enough soda bottles to maintain the ratio for 81 days.

So, the soda bottles would last for 81 days if she maintains the fixed ratio every day.","Debby has a total of 360 soda bottles and twice as many water bottles which is 2 x 162 = 324 water bottles.
The number of pairs of both types of bottles is 360 / 3 = 120.
This means that the soda bottles would last Debby 120 days, since she needs to consume 3 soda bottles every 2 days.
The final result is 120.","Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles. To find out how many days the soda bottles would last, we need to determine how many soda bottles she would drink each day and how many water bottles she would consume.

According to the fixed ratio, for every 3 soda bottles she drinks, she must also consume 2 water bottles.

Let's calculate the number of soda bottles she would drink each day:
3 soda bottles per day

Now, let's calculate the number of water bottles she would consume each day:
2 water bottles per day

Since she bought 360 soda bottles, we can find out how many days the soda bottles would last by dividing the total number of soda bottles by the number of soda bottles she would drink each day:

After the typhoon, the survival rate of each species was as follows: 50% for oak trees, 75% for maple trees, and 25% for pine trees. Calculate the number of trees that were lost in the typhoon for each species and the total number of trees lost.","To calculate the number of trees lost for each species, we first need to determine how many of each species survived the typhoon, and then subtract that number from the original number of trees.

For oak trees:
Survival rate = 50%
Number of oak trees before the typhoon = 8
Number of oak trees that survived = 50% of 8 = 0.50 * 8 = 4
Number of oak trees lost = Original number - Survived number = 8 - 4 = 4

For maple trees:
Survival rate = 75%
Number of maple trees before the typhoon = 6
Number of maple trees that survived = 75% of 6 = 0.75 * 6 = 4.5 (since we can't have half a tree, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 5)
Number of maple trees lost = Original number - Survived number = 6 - 5 = 1

For pine trees:
Survival rate = 25%
Number of pine trees before the typhoon = 6
Number of pine trees that survived = 25% of 6 = 0.25 * 6 = 1.5 (again, rounding to the nearest whole number, which is 2)
Number of pine trees lost = Original number - Survived number = 6 - 2 = 4

Now, to calculate the total number of trees lost:
Total trees lost = Oak trees lost + Maple trees lost + Pine trees lost
Total trees lost = 4 (oak) + 1 (maple) + 4 (pine)
Total trees lost = 9

Therefore, Haley lost 4 oak trees, 1 maple tree, and 4 pine trees, making a total of 9 trees lost in the typhoon.","Haley had a total of 20 trees, with 8 being oak. 
Oak trees lost: 8 * 50% = 4 trees
Maple trees lost: 6 * 25% = 1.5 trees
Pine trees lost: 6 * 75% = 4.5 trees
Total trees lost: 4 + 1.5 + 4.5 = 10 trees
10","First, let's calculate the number of trees lost for each species:

For oak trees:
50% survival rate means 50% of the trees were lost. So, 50% of 8 oak trees were lost.
Lost oak trees = 50% of 8
Lost oak trees = 0.50 * 8
Lost oak trees = 4

For maple trees:
75% survival rate means 25% of the trees were lost. So, 25% of 6 maple trees were lost.
Lost maple trees = 25% of 6
Lost maple trees = 0.25 * 6
Lost maple trees = 1.5

For pine trees:
25% survival rate means 75% of the trees were lost. So, 75% of 6 pine trees were lost.
Lost pine trees = 75% of 6
Lost pine trees = 0.75 * 6
Lost pine trees = 4.5

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees lost:

1. Baker initially had 173 cakes.
2. He bought an additional 103 cakes, but 25% were damaged. So, he only added 75% of the new cakes to his stock:
   75% of 103 cakes = 0.75 * 103 = 77.25 cakes
   Since we can't have a fraction of a cake, we'll round down to 77 cakes (assuming he can't sell the fraction of a cake).

3. Now, his total stock is:
   Initial stock + New undamaged cakes = 173 + 77 = 250 cakes

4. He sold 86 cakes, so his stock reduced to:
   250 - 86 = 164 cakes

5. On the next day, he sold another 10% of his remaining stock:
   10% of 164 cakes = 0.10 * 164 = 16.4 cakes
   Again, assuming we can't have a fraction of a cake, we'll round down to 16 cakes sold.

6. After the second day of sales, his remaining stock is:
   164 - 16 = 148 cakes

He buys 103 cakes, but as 25% are damaged, he only adds 75 (75% of 103) to his stock. This brings his total to 173 + 75 = 248 cakes.

He then sells 86 cakes, leaving him with 248 - 86 = 162 cakes.

The next day, he sells a further 10%, or 16.2 cakes, which we'll round down to 16 cakes.

Baker has 162 - 16 = 146 cakes left. 

The final result is: 146.","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Baker initially made 173 cakes.
2. He bought an additional 103 cakes, but 25% of these cakes were slightly damaged, so he only added 75% of the new cakes to his stock.
3. To find out how many new cakes he added, we calculate 75% of 103:
75% of 103 = 0.75 * 103 = 77.25
Since we can't have a fraction of a cake, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 77.
4. So, Baker added 77 new cakes to his stock.

He lost 16% of his crayons and 8% of his colored pencils. How many crayons and colored pencils had been lost or given away?,"First, let's calculate how many crayons and colored pencils Paul gave away.

Crayons given away:
3/5 of 65 crayons = (3/5) * 65 = 39 crayons

Colored pencils given away:
1/4 of 48 colored pencils = (1/4) * 48 = 12 colored pencils

Now, let's calculate how many crayons and colored pencils Paul lost.

Crayons lost:
16% of 65 crayons = (16/100) * 65 = 10.4 crayons
Since Paul can't lose a fraction of a crayon, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round down to 10 crayons because you can't lose part of a crayon.

Colored pencils lost:
8% of 48 colored pencils = (8/100) * 48 = 3.84 colored pencils

Total crayons lost or given away:
39 crayons given away + 10 crayons lost = 49 crayons

Final result: 66","First, let's calculate how many crayons Paul gave away:

Paul gave away 3/5 of his crayons. To find out how many crayons that is, we multiply 3/5 by the total number of crayons he had:

3/5 * 65 = 39 crayons

Now, let's calculate how many colored pencils Paul gave away:

Paul gave away 1/4 of his colored pencils. To find out how many colored pencils that is, we multiply 1/4 by the total number of colored pencils he had:

1/4 * 48 = 12 colored pencils

Next, let's calculate how many crayons Paul lost:

Paul lost 16% of his crayons. To find out how many crayons that is, we multiply 16% by the total number of crayons he had:

0.16 * 65 = 10.4 crayons

Since Paul can't lose a fraction of a crayon, we'll round this to the nearest whole number:

10.4 crayons ≈ 10 crayons

Paul lost 8% of his colored pencils. To find out how many colored pencils that is, we multiply 8% by the total number of colored pencils he had:

0.08 * 48 = 3.84 colored pencils

Since Paul can't lose a fraction of a colored pencil, we'll round this to the nearest whole number:

3.84 colored pencils ≈ 4 colored pencils

In total, Paul gave away 39 crayons and 12 colored pencils, and he lost 10 crayons and 4 colored pencils.

459,"A chef has 43 apples, each weighing 150g. After baking, he found that he used 2kg of apples for small pies and 2.5kg for large pies. He also discovered he has 2 apples left. How many small and large pies did he make if each small pie needs 300g of apples and each large pie needs 500g of apples?","First, let's find out the total weight of the apples the chef started with:

43 apples * 150g per apple = 6450g

Now, let's convert the kilograms of apples used for pies into grams to make it easier to calculate:

2kg for small pies = 2000g
2.5kg for large pies = 2500g

Total weight of apples used for pies = 2000g + 2500g = 4500g

Now, let's find out how many grams of apples are left:

6450g (initial total) - 4500g (used for pies) = 1950g

Since he has 2 apples left, we can calculate the weight of these apples:

2 apples * 150g per apple = 300g

Now, let's verify that the weight of the apples left matches the calculation:

1950g (calculated remaining weight) should be equal to 300g (actual remaining weight of 2 apples).

Since 1950g does not equal 300g, there seems to be a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the information given:

The chef used 2kg for small pies and 2.5kg for large pies, which totals 4.5kg or 4500g. He has 2 apples left, which means he used 41 apples for the pies.

The weight of the apples used for pies should be:

41 apples * 150g per apple = 6150g

Now, let's subtract the weight of the apples used for pies from the initial total weight:

6450g (initial total) - 6150g (used for pies) = 300g

This matches the weight of the 2 apples left, so the calculation is now correct.

Next, let's find out how many small and large pies he made:

For small pies, each pie needs 300g of apples. He used 2000g for small pies, so:

2000g / 300g per small pie = 6.67 small pies

Since he can't make a fraction of a pie, he must have made 6 small pies using 1800g of apples (6 pies * 300g per pie).

For large pies, each pie needs 500g of apples. He used 2500g for large pies, so:

2500g / 500g per large pie = 5 large pies

In conclusion, the chef made 6 small pies and 5 large pies.","The chef used 41 apples in total as 43 - 2 = 41.

For the small pies, the chef used 12.3kg of apples because 41 apples x 0.15kg = 6.15kg and 6.15kg / 0.3kg/pie = 20.5 pies.
For the large pies, the chef used 12.5kg of apples.
The number of small pies the chef made is 20 and the number of large pies is 5 because 2.5kg / 0.5kg/pie = 5 pies.

Therefore the total number of pies is 25.

Twenty-five.","First, let's find out how many apples the chef used in total for the pies.

The chef used 2kg for small pies and 2.5kg for large pies. Since each apple weighs 150g, we can convert the weight of the apples used into the number of apples by dividing the weight by the weight of one apple.

For the small pies:
2kg / 150g per apple = 13.33 apples (since we can't use a fraction of an apple, we'll round down to the nearest whole number)

For the large pies:
2.5kg / 150g per apple = 16.67 apples (again, we'll round down to the nearest whole number)

Now, let's add the number of apples used for both types of pies:
13.33 (small pies) + 16.67 (large pies) = 30 apples

The chef started with 43 apples and used 30 for the pies, so the number of apples left is:
43 apples - 30 apples = 13 apples

The chef has 2 apples left, so the number of apples used is:
13 apples (used) - 2 apples (left) = 11 apples

Now, let's find out how many small and large pies the chef made.

For the small pies, we know that each small pie needs 300g of apples. Since each apple weighs 150g, we can find out how many apples are needed for each small pie by dividing the weight of apples needed by the weight of one apple:
300g / 150g per apple = 2 apples per small pie

For the large pies, we know that each large pie needs 500g of apples. Again, we can find out how many apples are needed for each large pie by dividing the weight of apples needed by the weight of one apple:
500g / 150g per apple = 3.33 apples per large pie (since we can't use a fraction of an apple, we'll round down to the nearest whole number)

Now, let's calculate the number of small and large pies:
For small pies:
11 apples (used) / 2 apples per small pie = 5.5 small pies (since we can't use a fraction of a pie, we'll round down to the nearest whole number)

For large pies:
11 apples (used) / 3.33 apples per large pie = 3.33 large pies (again, we'll round down to the nearest whole number)

So, the chef made 5.5 small pies and",Twenty-five,5.5,six small pies and five large pies
460,"John had 26 aquariums for saltwater animals. Each aquarium had an odd number of animals that was more than one. The aquariums had a total of 52 saltwater animals. Considering that each aquarium has the same number of animals, how many saltwater animals does each aquarium have?","Let's denote the number of saltwater animals in each aquarium as \( x \). Since each aquarium has an odd number of animals and there are 26 aquariums, the total number of animals can be represented as \( 26x \).

We are given that the total number of saltwater animals is 52. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 26x = 52 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 26:

\[ x = \frac{52}{26} \]
\[ x = 2 \]

However, we are told that each aquarium has an odd number of animals, and 2 is not an odd number. This means there must be a mistake in our initial assumption that each aquarium has the same number of animals.

Since the total number of animals is 52 and there are 26 aquariums, if each aquarium had the same number of animals, the number of animals per aquarium would have to be a factor of 52. The factors of 52 are 1, 2, 4, 13, 26, and 52. The only odd number greater than 1 among these factors is 13.

Therefore, each aquarium must have 13 saltwater animals, which is an odd number and satisfies the condition that each aquarium has more than one animal.","We know that the total number of animals is divisible by the total number of aquariums, and the number of animals in each aquarium is odd. Therefore, we can divide the total number of animals by the number of aquariums:

52 animals / 26 aquariums = 2 animals per aquarium

The result is 2.","Let's denote the number of saltwater animals in each aquarium as x.

According to the information given, each aquarium has an odd number of animals that is more than one. This means that x must be an odd number greater than 1.

The total number of saltwater animals is given as 52. Since each aquarium has the same number of animals, we can set up the following equation:

26 * x = 52

Now, we need to find the value of x that satisfies the equation. Since x must be an odd number greater than 1, we can start by dividing 52 by 26 to find the quotient and the remainder.

52 ÷ 26 = 2 with a remainder of 0

This means that each aquarium has 2 saltwater animals. However, since x must be an odd number greater than 1, this result is not possible.

461,"Initially, there were some birds sitting on the fence. Later, 4 more birds came to join them, but at the same time, 3 birds flew away. After that, 6 more birds joined the ones on the fence. If there are a total of 12 birds on the fence now, how many birds were sitting on the fence at the start?","Let's call the number of birds sitting on the fence at the start B.

According to the information given:

After 4 more birds came and 3 flew away, the number of birds on the fence would be B + 4 - 3.

Then, 6 more birds joined, so the number of birds on the fence would be (B + 4 - 3) + 6.

We know that the total number of birds on the fence after all these changes is 12, so we can set up the following equation:

(B + 4 - 3) + 6 = 12

Simplifying the equation:

B + 1 + 6 = 12
B + 7 = 12

Now, subtract 7 from both sides to solve for B:

B = 12 - 7
B = 5

So, there were 5 birds sitting on the fence at the start.","There were 3 birds sitting on the fence initially.

Then, 6 more birds joined, making it B + 1 + 6 = B + 7 birds on the fence.

We are told that there are a total of 12 birds on the fence now, so we can set up the equation:

462,"Initially, there were 21 roses and 17 daisies in the vase. Jessica threw away 34 roses and 25 daisies from the vase, and cut some more new roses and daisies from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now, there are 15 roses and 10 daisies in the vase. Jessica also had only 2 hours to complete all these tasks - picking flowers from her garden, throwing some away, and rearranging them. How many more flowers (roses and daisies combined) did she throw away than those she cut from her garden within the given time constraint?","Let's first calculate how many roses and daisies Jessica threw away:

Jessica threw away 34 roses and 25 daisies.

Now let's calculate how many roses and daisies are in the vase after she completed her tasks:

There are 15 roses and 10 daisies in the vase now.

Since Jessica threw away more roses and daisies than she initially had, she must have cut some from her garden to make up the difference. Let's calculate how many she cut:

For roses:
She had 21 initially, threw away 34, and now has 15.
So, she must have cut (34 - 21) + 15 = 13 + 15 = 28 roses from her garden.

For daisies:
She had 17 initially, threw away 25, and now has 10.
So, she must have cut (25 - 17) + 10 = 8 + 10 = 18 daisies from her garden.

Now let's calculate the total number of flowers she cut from her garden:

28 roses + 18 daisies = 46 flowers cut from the garden.

Now let's calculate the total number of flowers she threw away:

34 roses + 25 daisies = 59 flowers thrown away.

To find out how many more flowers she threw away than those she cut from her garden, we subtract the number of flowers cut from the garden from the number of flowers thrown away:

59 flowers thrown away - 46 flowers cut from the garden = 13 more flowers thrown away than cut from the garden.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Start: Roses = 21, Daisies = 17

2. Throw away flowers: Roses = 21 - 34 = -13, Daisies = 17 - 25 = -8

3. Negative values indicate a decrease, so we remove the minus sign and make the values positive: Roses = 13, Daisies = 8

4. Cut new flowers: Roses = 13 + unknown roses cut, Daisies = 8 + unknown daisies cut

5. End: Roses = 13 + cut flowers = 15 (from the problem), Daisies = 8 + cut flowers = 10

We now know that the unknown number of roses cut is 2, and the unknown number of daisies cut is also 2.

Adding these together, the final result is **4**.","First, let's find out how many roses and daisies Jessica threw away:

Then Haley managed to grow 2 new apple trees, 1 new orange tree, and 2 new lemon trees. How many trees of each type does Haley have now?","Let's calculate the number of trees that survived the typhoon for each type:

Apple trees: Haley had 3 apple trees, and 50% died. So, 50% of 3 is 1.5, but since we can't have half a tree, we'll round down to 1 tree that died. Therefore, 3 - 1 = 2 apple trees survived.

Orange trees: Haley had 4 orange trees, and 75% died. So, 75% of 4 is 3 trees that died. Therefore, 4 - 3 = 1 orange tree survived.

Lemon trees: Haley had 2 lemon trees, and 1 died. Therefore, 2 - 1 = 1 lemon tree survived.

Now, let's add the new trees that Haley managed to grow:

New apple trees: 2 survived + 2 new = 4 apple trees now.
New orange trees: 1 survived + 1 new = 2 orange trees now.
New lemon trees: 1 survived + 2 new = 3 lemon trees now.

470,"Mary is baking a cake, and she needs to use the exact ratio of ingredients required by the recipe to ensure the cake turns out perfectly. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour (F) and 4 cups of sugar (S) for every 2 tablespoons of baking powder (P). She has already used 3x cups of flour, 2x tablespoons of baking powder, and y cups of sugar. If x and y are integers, and Mary needs to add 12 more cups of flour than sugar to maintain the perfect ratio regarding the recipe, how many more cups of flour does she need to add?","To maintain the perfect ratio, we need to ensure that the relationship between flour, sugar, and baking powder remains constant. According to the recipe, the ratio is 6 cups of flour (F) to 4 cups of sugar (S) to 2 tablespoons of baking powder (P), which simplifies to 3F:2S:1P.

Mary has already used 3x cups of flour and 2x tablespoons of baking powder. To find out how much sugar she should have used to maintain the ratio, we can set up the following proportion based on the ratio of flour to baking powder:

3F : 1P = 3x : 2x

Since the ratio of flour to baking powder is 3:1, we can write:

3/1 = 3x/2x

This simplifies to:

3 = 3x/2x

Since 3x/2x is just x (because the x's cancel out), we find that Mary should have used x cups of sugar to maintain the ratio.

Now, we know that Mary has used y cups of sugar, and she needs to add 12 more cups of flour than sugar to maintain the perfect ratio. This means:

Flour to be added = Sugar to be added + 12

Since she has already used y cups of sugar, the total amount of sugar she needs to use to maintain the ratio is x cups (as we found above). Therefore, the additional sugar she needs to add is:

Sugar to be added = x - y

Now, we can find the additional flour she needs to add:

Flour to be added = (x - y) + 12

Since we are looking for the total additional cups of flour Mary needs to add, we can use the expression above. However, we don't have specific values for x and y, as they are variables. Mary will need to calculate the exact amount based on the values of x and y she has for her specific situation.","Mary has already used x = 3 cups of flour and y cups of sugar. The ratio requires F:S = 6:4, and she needs to maintain this ratio when adding more ingredients. 

We know that:
3x + y = z cups of flour
and 
z + 12 cups of flour = 6z cups of flour is required to maintain the ratio. 

Therefore, to find the value of z:
3x + y = z
z + 12 = 6z

Combining both equations:
3x + y + z = z + 12 = 6z
2z = 12
z = 6

The value of z is 6, so Mary needs to add an additional 6 cups of flour to have the correct ratio. 

The final result is 6.","Let's denote the ratio of flour to sugar to baking powder as F:S:P. According to the recipe, this ratio is 6:4:2.

Mary has already used 3x cups of flour, 2x tablespoons of baking powder, and y cups of sugar. We need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add to maintain the perfect ratio.

First, let's convert the tablespoons of baking powder to cups. Since there are 2 tablespoons in a cup, 2x tablespoons would be 2x/2 = x cups of baking powder.

Now, let's set up the ratio of flour to sugar to baking powder that Mary has already used:

F:S:P = 3x:y:x

To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we need to determine the ratio of flour to sugar that she has already used. We can do this by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar:

F/S = 3x/y

Now, we know that Mary needs to add 12 more cups of flour than sugar to maintain the perfect ratio. This means that the ratio of flour to sugar that she has already used must be 12:1. So, we can set up the equation:

3x/y = 12

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 12y/3

Since x and y are integers, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

x = (12y/3) / 3
x = 4y

Now we have the value of x, which is 4y. We can now find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add by using the ratio of flour to sugar that she has already used:

F/S = 3x/y = 3(4y)/y = 12

Since Mary needs to add 12 more cups of flour than sugar, and the ratio of flour to sugar that she has already used is 12:1, she needs to add 12 cups of flour to maintain the perfect ratio.",6,12,Flour to be added = Sugar to be added + 12

Species B: 120 bird families; 50% fly to Africa, 50% fly to Asia
Species C: 30 bird families; 10% fly to Africa, 90% fly to Asia

Taking into account the different migration patterns of each species of bird, calculate the difference in the number of bird families migrating to Asia and Africa.","First, let's calculate the number of bird families from each species migrating to Africa and Asia.

Species A:
- To Africa: 100 families * 35% = 35 families
- To Asia: 100 families * 65% = 65 families

Species B:
- To Africa: 120 families * 50% = 60 families
- To Asia: 120 families * 50% = 60 families

Species C:
- To Africa: 30 families * 10% = 3 families
- To Asia: 30 families * 90% = 27 families

Now, let's sum up the number of families migrating to each continent.

To Africa:
- Total = Species A to Africa + Species B to Africa + Species C to Africa
- Total = 35 + 60 + 3
- Total = 98 families

To Asia:
- Total = Species A to Asia + Species B to Asia + Species C to Asia
- Total = 65 + 60 + 27
- Total = 152 families

Finally, let's calculate the difference in the number of bird families migrating to Asia and Africa.

Difference = Number to Asia - Number to Africa
Difference = 152 families - 98 families
Difference = 54 families

So, there is a difference of 54 bird families migrating to Asia compared to Africa.","We have:

Species A:
- 35% of 100 families fly to Africa (35 bird families)
- 65% of 100 families fly to Asia (65 bird families)

Species B:
- 50% of 120 families fly to Africa (60 bird families)
- 50% of 120 families fly to Asia (60 bird families)

Species C:
- 10% of 30 families fly to Africa (3 bird families)
- 90% of 30 families fly to Asia (27 bird families)

To find the total number of bird families migrating to each continent, we add the corresponding percentages together.

Africa: 35 + 60 + 3 = 98 bird families
Asia: 65 + 60 + 27 = 152 bird families

The difference in migration numbers is 152 - 98 = 54 bird families.

The final result is 54.","Let's calculate the number of bird families from each species that migrate to Africa and Asia.

Species A:
- Africa: 35% of 100 bird families = 0.35 * 100 = 35 bird families
- Asia: 65% of 100 bird families = 0.65 * 100 = 65 bird families

Species B:
- Africa: 50% of 120 bird families = 0.50 * 120 = 60 bird families
- Asia: 50% of 120 bird families = 0.50 * 120 = 60 bird families

Species C:
- Africa: 10% of 30 bird families = 0.10 * 30 = 3 bird families
- Asia: 90% of 30 bird families = 0.90 * 30 = 27 bird families

Now, let's calculate the total number of bird families migrating to Africa and Asia for each species:

Species A:
- Africa: 35 bird families
- Asia: 65 bird families

Species B:
- Africa: 60 bird families
- Asia: 60 bird families

Species C:
- Africa: 3 bird families
- Asia: 27 bird families

Finally, let's calculate the difference in the number of bird families migrating to Asia and Africa for each species:

Species A:
- Asia - Africa = 65 - 35 = 30 bird families

Species B:
- Asia - Africa = 60 - 60 = 0 bird families

Species C:
- Asia - Africa = 27 - 3 = 24 bird families

Now, let's add up the differences for all species:

Total difference = Species A + Species B + Species C
Total difference = 30 + 0 + 24
Total difference = 54 bird families

So, the difference in the number of bird families migrating to Asia and Africa is 54 bird families.",54,fifty-four,54
472,He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 58 sacks of ripe oranges and 37 sacks of unripe oranges per day. How many sacks of unripe oranges will they have after 72 days of harvest?,"To find out how many sacks of unripe oranges they will have after 72 days of harvest, we need to multiply the number of sacks of unripe oranges they harvest per day by the number of days they harvest.

Number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day = 37
Number of days of harvest = 72

Total sacks of unripe oranges after 72 days = 37 sacks/day * 72 days

Now, let's do the multiplication:

Total sacks of unripe oranges after 72 days = 2664 sacks

So, they will have 2664 sacks of unripe oranges after 72 days of harvest.","They harvest 95 sacks of unripe oranges per day because 58 + 37 = 95.
After 72 days, they will have 6,840 sacks of unripe oranges because 95 x 72 = 6,840.
The final result is 6840.","If they harvest 58 sacks of ripe oranges and 37 sacks of unripe oranges per day, then after 72 days of harvest, they will have:

58 sacks/day * 72 days = 4176 sacks of ripe oranges

473,"Brenda's mother made cookies for guests. She made two types of cookies: chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin. For every two guests, one guest received 3 chocolate chip cookies, and the other received 2 oatmeal raisin cookies. If she prepared a total of 22 chocolate chip cookies and 18 oatmeal raisin cookies, how many guests did she prepare cookies for?","Let's denote the number of guests who received chocolate chip cookies as Gc and the number of guests who received oatmeal raisin cookies as Go.

According to the problem, for every two guests, one guest received 3 chocolate chip cookies, and the other received 2 oatmeal raisin cookies. This means that the number of guests who received chocolate chip cookies is equal to the number of guests who received oatmeal raisin cookies (since they are paired up, one of each for every two guests).

So, Gc = Go.

Now, let's calculate how many guests received chocolate chip cookies based on the total number of chocolate chip cookies prepared:

22 chocolate chip cookies / 3 cookies per guest = 22 / 3 = 7.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a guest, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 7 guests who received chocolate chip cookies.

Now, let's calculate how many guests received oatmeal raisin cookies based on the total number of oatmeal raisin cookies prepared:

18 oatmeal raisin cookies / 2 cookies per guest = 18 / 2 = 9 guests who received oatmeal raisin cookies.

Since we know that the number of guests who received chocolate chip cookies is equal to the number of guests who received oatmeal raisin cookies, we can conclude that there were 9 guests in total (since we can't have more guests receiving chocolate chip cookies than the total number of oatmeal raisin cookies allows).

Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared cookies for 9 guests in total.","We know that for every two guests, one receives 3 chocolate chip cookies and the other gets 2 oatmeal raisin cookies. We also have a total of 22 chocolate chip cookies and 18 oatmeal raisin cookies. 

We can set up a simple equation: 
Number of guests = Total chocolate chip cookies / 3, since half of the guests will receive these cookies. 

This equation gives us:
Number of guests = 22 / 3, which equals 7.33, or seven guests in total. 

Seven guests were prepared for.","Let's denote the number of guests as G.

For every two guests, one guest receives 3 chocolate chip cookies and the other receives 2 oatmeal raisin cookies. This means that for every two guests, they receive a total of 3 chocolate chip cookies + 2 oatmeal raisin cookies = 5 cookies.

Since Brenda's mother prepared a total of 22 chocolate chip cookies, we can find out how many sets of 5 cookies she could make with these chocolate chip cookies:

22 chocolate chip cookies ÷ 5 cookies per set = 4.4 sets

Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 4 sets.

Now, let's find out how many sets of 5 cookies she could make with the 18 oatmeal raisin cookies:

18 oatmeal raisin cookies ÷ 5 cookies per set = 3.6 sets

Again, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3 sets.

Now, we know that for every two guests, they receive 5 cookies (3 chocolate chip cookies and 2 oatmeal raisin cookies). So, for every two guests, we have 1 set of 5 cookies.

Since we have 4 sets of 5 cookies from the chocolate chip cookies and 3 sets of 5 cookies from the oatmeal raisin cookies, we can find the total number of sets by adding these together:

4 chocolate chip sets + 3 oatmeal raisin sets = 7 sets

Now, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per set to find the total number of guests:

22 chocolate chip cookies + 18 oatmeal raisin cookies = 40 cookies
40 cookies ÷ 5 cookies per set = 8 sets

Since we have 7 sets of 5 cookies, we divide the total number of sets by the number of sets per two guests to find the total number of guests:

7 sets ÷ 1 set per two guests = 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5 guests

Again, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3 guests.

Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared cookies for 3 guests.",Seven.,Three.,nine
474,"Lawrence county has 313,473 kids. During summer break 274,865 kids stay home and the rest either go to one of the three available summer camps or wait for an open spot. The duration of the camps are 2, 3, and 4 weeks, and kids can only attend one camp during the break.

Camp A has a capacity of 5,000 kids for the 2-week camp.
Camp B has a capacity of 3,500 kids for the 3-week camp.
Camp C has a capacity of 1,500 kids for the 4-week camp.

Given the capacities and durations, how many total weeks of camp are available throughout the summer break? Additionally, how many kids in Lawrence county are either waiting for an open spot or not attending camp at all?","First, let's calculate the total number of weeks of camp available for each camp:

Camp A: 5,000 kids for a 2-week camp = 5,000 kids * 2 weeks = 10,000 camp weeks
Camp B: 3,500 kids for a 3-week camp = 3,500 kids * 3 weeks = 10,500 camp weeks
Camp C: 1,500 kids for a 4-week camp = 1,500 kids * 4 weeks = 6,000 camp weeks

Now, let's add up the total weeks of camp available:

Total camp weeks = Camp A weeks + Camp B weeks + Camp C weeks
Total camp weeks = 10,000 + 10,500 + 6,000
Total camp weeks = 26,500 camp weeks

Next, let's calculate how many kids are either waiting for an open spot or not attending camp at all:

Total number of kids in Lawrence county = 313,473
Number of kids staying home = 274,865

Number of kids attending camps = Camp A capacity + Camp B capacity + Camp C capacity
Number of kids attending camps = 5,000 + 3,500 + 1,500
Number of kids attending camps = 10,000

Now, let's subtract the number of kids staying home and the number of kids attending camps from the total number of kids:

Kids waiting or not attending = Total number of kids - (Number of kids staying home + Number of kids attending camps)
Kids waiting or not attending = 313,473 - (274,865 + 10,000)
Kids waiting or not attending = 313,473 - 284,865
Kids waiting or not attending = 28,608

So, there are 26,500 total weeks of camp available throughout the summer break, and 28,608 kids in Lawrence county are either waiting for an open spot or not attending camp at all.","Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we find the total capacity of the camps:
Camp A: 2 weeks x 5,000 kids = 10,000 weeks
Camp B: 3 weeks x 3,500 kids = 10,500 weeks
Camp C: 4 weeks x 1,500 kids = 6,000 weeks

Next, we sum up the weeks to find the total:
10,000 + 10,500 + 6,000 = 26,500 weeks

For the second part of the question, we need to find out the number of kids not attending any of the camps.

Now, let's calculate the total number of weeks of camp available:

Camp A: 5,000 kids * 2 weeks = 10,000 weeks
Camp B: 3,500 kids * 3 weeks = 10,500 weeks
Camp C: 1,500 kids * 4 weeks = 6,000 weeks

Total weeks of camp available = 10,000 weeks (Camp A) + 10,500 weeks (Camp B) + 6,000 weeks (Camp C) = 26,500 weeks

Next, let's find out how many kids are either waiting for an open spot or not attending camp at all:

Total kids in Lawrence county = 313,473 kids

She already put in some cups of flour and still needs to add 2 more cups of flour to meet the given ratio. How many cups of sugar should Mary add to the mixture to maintain the correct ratio, given the amount of flour she has already added?","Let's denote the number of cups of flour Mary has already added as F. According to the problem, she needs to add 2 more cups of flour to meet the given ratio. So, the total amount of flour she will have added is F + 2 cups.

The recipe calls for a ratio of 12 cups of flour to 5 cups of sugar. To maintain this ratio, we can set up a proportion:

Flour / Sugar = 12 / 5

We know that Mary will have F + 2 cups of flour, so we can write:

(F + 2) / Sugar = 12 / 5

To find the amount of sugar (S) needed, we can cross-multiply and solve for S:

5 * (F + 2) = 12 * S
5F + 10 = 12S

Now, we need to express F in terms of the original ratio. Since Mary still needs to add 2 cups of flour to meet the ratio, we can say that the amount of flour she has already added (F) is 12 - 2 = 10 cups. This is because if she had already added 12 cups, she wouldn't need to add any more flour to meet the ratio.

Substituting F = 10 into the equation:

5 * (10 + 2) = 12 * S
5 * 12 = 12 * S
60 = 12 * S

Now, divide both sides by 12 to solve for S:

S = 60 / 12
S = 5

Mary should add 5 cups of sugar to maintain the correct ratio with the amount of flour she has already added plus the 2 more cups she plans to add.","Mary has already started adding flour, but we do not know how many cups she has added. We do know, however, that the ratio of flour to sugar changes depending on how much flour is added. We can solve this problem with a simple equation:

If the ratio is 12 cups of flour to 5 cups of sugar, we can set up the equation as follows: 

12x = 5y 

We know she has added some unknown amount of flour, say F cups, and needs to add 2 more cups, which means our new ratio equation becomes: 

12(F + 2) = 5z

Solving for y, the number of cups of sugar Mary should add to maintain the ratio, we get: 

z = 2 + (4/5)x 

So, the final amount of sugar needed is 2 cups more than the amount of flour already added. 

Therefore, 2 cups.","Let's denote the amount of flour Mary has already added as F. According to the given ratio, for every 12 cups of flour, there should be 5 cups of sugar.

To find out how many cups of sugar Mary should add, we first need to determine how many cups of sugar she should have added based on the amount of flour she has already added.

Since the ratio is 12:5, we can set up a proportion to find out how many cups of sugar should be added for every 12 cups of flour:

12:5 = F:(5 + 2)

Now, we solve for the unknown number of cups of sugar (S):

12 * S = 5 * (F + 2)

We know that F = 10 (since she still needs to add 2 more cups of flour to meet the given ratio), so we can substitute F with 10:

12 * S = 5 * (10 + 2)
12 * S = 5 * 12

If Jake brought 4 helium balloons and 2 foil balloons to the park, how much more did Jake spend on balloons than Allan?","First, let's calculate how much Allan spent on his balloons:

He bought 2 helium balloons at $1.50 each, so that's 2 * $1.50 = $3.00 for helium balloons.
He also bought 3 foil balloons at $2.50 each, so that's 3 * $2.50 = $7.50 for foil balloons.
In total, Allan spent $3.00 + $7.50 = $10.50 on balloons.

Now, let's calculate how much Jake spent on his balloons:

He brought 4 helium balloons at $1.50 each, so that's 4 * $1.50 = $6.00 for helium balloons.
He also brought 2 foil balloons at $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00 for foil balloons.
In total, Jake spent $6.00 + $5.00 = $11.00 on balloons.

To find out how much more Jake spent than Allan, we subtract Allan's total from Jake's total:

Jake's total ($11.00) - Allan's total ($10.50) = $0.50 more spent by Jake.","Allan spent $3 on helium balloons and $5 on foil balloons, which totals $8. 
Jake spent $6 on helium balloons and $5 on foil balloons, which totals $11. 
Jake spent $3 more than Allan. 

$3","First, let's calculate the total cost of the balloons for Allan:

Allan bought 2 helium balloons at $1.50 each, so the cost for the helium balloons is:
2 helium balloons * $1.50 each = $3.00

Allan also bought 3 foil balloons at $2.50 each, so the cost for the foil balloons is:
3 foil balloons * $2.50 each = $7.50

Now, let's add the cost of the helium and foil balloons for Allan:
$3.00 (helium) + $7.50 (foil) = $10.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the balloons for Jake:

Jake brought 4 helium balloons at $1.50 each, so the cost for the helium balloons is:
4 helium balloons * $1.50 each = $6.00

She has already added 8 cups of flour, 12 cups of sugar, and 15 cups of cocoa powder. What is the ratio of the remaining amount of flour she needs to add to the total amount of sugar and cocoa powder she still needs to add?","First, let's calculate the remaining amount of each ingredient Mary needs to add:

Flour: She needs 25 cups in total and has already added 8 cups, so she needs to add 25 - 8 = 17 cups more.

Sugar: She needs 13 cups in total and has already added 12 cups, so she needs to add 13 - 12 = 1 cup more.

Cocoa powder: She needs 60 cups in total and has already added 15 cups, so she needs to add 60 - 15 = 45 cups more.

Now, let's find the ratio of the remaining flour to the total remaining sugar and cocoa powder:

The total remaining sugar and cocoa powder is 1 cup (sugar) + 45 cups (cocoa powder) = 46 cups.

The ratio of the remaining flour to the total remaining sugar and cocoa powder is 17 (flour) : 46 (sugar + cocoa powder).

25 cups - 8 cups = 17 cups of flour

Now, let's find out how much more sugar and cocoa powder she needs to add. The recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar and 60 cups of cocoa powder. She has already added 12 cups of sugar and 15 cups of cocoa powder. So, she still needs to add:

For sugar: 13 cups - 12 cups = 1 cup

If 228 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, 337 suggested adding bacon, 23 suggested adding tomatoes, 112 suggested adding fried chicken, and 48 students suggested adding lasagna. For every 7 students who suggested tomatoes, 3 students suggested sushi. How many more students suggested bacon than those that suggested tomatoes, and how many students suggested sushi?","To find out how many more students suggested bacon than those that suggested tomatoes, we subtract the number of students who suggested tomatoes from the number of students who suggested bacon:

Number of students who suggested bacon - Number of students who suggested tomatoes = Difference
337 (bacon) - 23 (tomatoes) = 314

So, 314 more students suggested bacon than those that suggested tomatoes.

To find out how many students suggested sushi, we use the ratio given: for every 7 students who suggested tomatoes, 3 students suggested sushi. We can set up a proportion to find the number of students who suggested sushi:

7 students (tomatoes) : 3 students (sushi) = 23 students (actual number of students who suggested tomatoes) : x students (actual number of students who suggested sushi)

Now we solve for x:

(7 students / 3 students) = (23 students / x students)

7x = 23 * 3

7x = 69

x = 69 / 7

x = 9.857 (approximately)

Since the number of students cannot be a fraction, we round the number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, approximately 10 students suggested sushi.","We have:
228 students suggested mashed potatoes
337 suggested bacon
23 suggested tomatoes
112 suggested fried chicken

For every 7 students who suggested tomatoes, 3 suggested sushi, so we can find the number of sushi suggestions by multiplying the number of tomato suggestions by 3 and dividing by 7:
(23 x 3) / 7 = 12 students suggested sushi.

Now, to find the difference in suggestions between bacon and tomatoes, we subtract the latter from the former:
337 - 23 = 314 students suggested bacon more than tomatoes.

The result is 314.","First, let's find out how many more students suggested bacon than those that suggested tomatoes.

There were 23 students who suggested adding tomatoes. For every 7 students who suggested tomatoes, 3 students suggested sushi. So, we need to find out how many sets of 7 students there are in the 23 students who suggested tomatoes.

23 ÷ 7 = 3 sets of 7 students.

Ron's height = 12 feet
Dean's height = Ron's height - 11 feet = 12 feet - 11 feet = 1 foot
Sam's height = Dean's height + 2 feet = 1 foot + 2 feet = 3 feet

Now, let's calculate the depth each one dives to:

Ron's diving depth = half his height = 12 feet / 2 = 6 feet
Sam's diving depth = equal to his height = 3 feet
Dean's diving depth = his height + 3 feet = 1 foot + 3 feet = 4 feet

Finally, let's add up their combined depths underwater:

Combined depths = Ron's depth + Sam's depth + Dean's depth
Combined depths = 6 feet + 3 feet + 4 feet = 13 feet

Out of these, 18 were bottles of regular soda, 14 were bottles of diet soda, 8 were bottles of fruit juice, 10 were bottles of sparkling water, and the rest were bottles of energy drinks. What is the ratio of diet soda to the total number of bottles?","To find the ratio of diet soda to the total number of bottles, we first need to determine the total number of diet soda bottles and the total number of bottles.

According to the information provided, there are 14 bottles of diet soda.

The total number of bottles is given as 60.

The ratio of diet soda to the total number of bottles is therefore 14 to 60.

To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor. In this case, the greatest common divisor of 14 and 60 is 2.

Dividing both numbers by 2, we get:

14 ÷ 2 = 7
60 ÷ 2 = 30

So, the simplified ratio of diet soda to the total number of bottles is 7 to 30.","We are asked to find the ratio of diet soda to the total number of bottles. We have been given the following information:

1. There are 18 bottles of regular soda.
2. There are 14 bottles of diet soda.
3. There are 8 bottles of fruit juice.
4. There are 10 bottles of sparkling water.

We need to find the total number of bottles to calculate the ratio. Adding the number of bottles of each type mentioned above gives:
18 (regular soda) + 14 (diet soda) + 8 (fruit juice) + 10 (sparkling water) = 50 bottles.

It is also mentioned that the remaining bottles are energy drinks. So, the total number of bottles is 50 + the unknown number of energy drinks.

To find the ratio of diet soda to the total number of bottles, we need to first find the number of energy drink bottles. We'll subtract the sum of the other bottles from the total of 60:

60 - 50 = 10 bottles of energy drinks.

Now that we have the total number of bottles (50 + 10 = 60), we can find the ratio. There are 14 bottles of diet soda, and the total number of bottles is 60. This can be written as:

14/60.

This simplifies to 1/4.

The final result is: **one quarter**.","To find the ratio of diet soda to the total number of bottles, we first need to determine the total number of bottles that are not diet soda.

We know that there are 18 bottles of regular soda, 8 bottles of fruit juice, 10 bottles of sparkling water, and the rest are bottles of energy drinks.

Let's denote the number of bottles of energy drinks as x.

The total number of bottles that are not diet soda is:
18 (regular soda) + 8 (fruit juice) + 10 (sparkling water) + x (energy drinks)

We are given that the total number of bottles is 60, so we can set up the equation:

18 + 8 + 10 + x = 60

Now, let's solve for x:

18 + 8 + 10 + x = 60
36 + 10 + x = 60
46 + x = 60
x = 60 - 46
x = 14

So, there are 14 bottles of energy drinks.

Now, we can find the total number of bottles that are not diet soda:

18 (regular soda) + 8 (fruit juice) + 10 (sparkling water) + 14 (energy drinks) = 50

The total number of bottles is 60, so the number of bottles of diet soda is:

60 (total bottles) - 50 (bottles not diet soda) = 10

Now, we can find the ratio of diet soda to the total number of bottles:

For cakes:
Matthew has 180 cakes, and the ratio for cakes is 5 units. So, each unit for cakes is 180 cakes / 5 units = 36 cakes per unit.

Since Matthew gave crackers and cakes to his 6 friends, we need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends to find out how many crackers each person ate.

Each person ate 3 units of crackers, so each person ate 3 units * 24 crackers per unit = 72 crackers.

Since there are 6 friends, we divide the 72 crackers by 6 to find out how many crackers each person ate:

72 crackers / 6 friends = 12 crackers per person.

The final result is 12.","Let's denote the number of crackers each person eats as C. According to the given ratio, for every 3 crackers, there are 5 cakes. So, for every 3 crackers, there are 5/3 cakes.

We know that Matthew had 72 crackers and 180 cakes initially. We can set up the following equation to represent the ratio of crackers to cakes:

72 crackers / 180 cakes = 3 crackers / 5 cakes

Now, we can solve for C:

Today, with setting B, it produced 3 shirts in just 5 minutes. In addition, the machine experienced a total of 120 minutes of downtime on both days due to maintenance. How many minutes did the machine work in all, including the downtime?","First, let's calculate the total working time for each day, excluding downtime.

On the first day with setting A:
The machine made 13 shirts in 75 minutes.

On the second day with setting B:
The machine made 3 shirts in 5 minutes.

Now, let's add the working time for both days:
75 minutes (day 1) + 5 minutes (day 2) = 80 minutes of working time.

Next, we need to include the downtime:
The machine experienced a total of 120 minutes of downtime over the two days.

Finally, let's add the working time and the downtime to get the total time the machine was in use:
80 minutes (working time) + 120 minutes (downtime) = 200 minutes.

So, the machine worked for a total of 200 minutes, including the downtime.","The machine worked 13 x 75 minutes with setting A and 3 x 5 minutes with setting B, which equals 975 minutes in total. Together with the 120 minutes of downtime, the machine was in operation for a total of 1095 minutes.

One thousand ninety-five minutes.","First, let's calculate the total number of shirts produced on both days.

With setting A, the machine produced 13 shirts in 75 minutes.
With setting B, the machine produced 3 shirts in 5 minutes.

So, the total number of shirts produced is:
13 shirts (setting A) + 3 shirts (setting B) = 16 shirts

Now, let's calculate the total time the machine worked, including the downtime.

The machine worked for 75 minutes with setting A and 5 minutes with setting B.
The total time the machine worked is:
75 minutes (setting A) + 5 minutes (setting B) = 80 minutes

The machine experienced 120 minutes of downtime on both days.

To find the total time the machine worked, including the downtime, we add the downtime to the total working time:

494,"Haley originally planted 150 trees in her orchard. After a severe typhoon, 92 trees died and 15 trees were left with only slight damages. How many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived without any damages or slight damages?","To find out how many trees survived without any damages or slight damages, we need to subtract the number of trees that died and the number of trees with slight damages from the original number of trees.

Number of trees that died = 92
Number of trees with slight damages = 15

Total trees affected by the typhoon = 92 (dead) + 15 (slightly damaged) = 107

Now, we subtract the total trees affected by the typhoon from the original number of trees to find out how many trees survived without any damages or slight damages.

Original number of trees = 150
Total trees affected by the typhoon = 107

Trees that survived without any damages or slight damages = 150 - 107 = 43

Now, to find out how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived without any damages or slight damages, we subtract the number of trees that survived without any damages or slight damages from the number of trees that died.

Number of trees that died = 92
Trees that survived without any damages or slight damages = 43

Number of trees that died more than those that survived without any damages or slight damages = 92 - 43 = 49

So, 49 more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived without any damages or slight damages.","There were 150 - 92 = 58 trees that survived the typhoon.
Out of those 58, 15 had slight damages, so 58 - 15 = 43 trees survived without any damages.
Therefore, 92 - 43 = 49 trees died in the typhoon.

Result: 49.","Haley originally planted 150 trees in her orchard. After the severe typhoon, 92 trees died and 15 trees were left with only slight damages.

To find out how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived without any damages or slight damages, we first need to determine the number of trees that survived without any damages or slight damages.

The number of trees that survived without any damages or slight damages is the total number of trees minus the number of trees that died and the number of trees that were left with only slight damages.

So, the number of trees that survived without any damages or slight damages is:
150 (total number of trees) - 92 (trees that died) - 15 (trees with slight damages) = 43 trees.

Now, to find out how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived without any damages or slight damages, we subtract the number of trees that survived without any damages or slight damages from the total number of trees that died:

92 (trees that died) - 43 (trees that survived without damages or slight damages) = 49 trees.

495,"Let x be the number of sweet cookies Paco ate, and y be the number of salty cookies Paco ate. If Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies, and he ate (x/2) sweet cookies and (3y/5) salty cookies, how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies did he eat?","Let's first find out how many sweet cookies Paco ate. Since he ate (x/2) sweet cookies and there were 40 sweet cookies in total, we can set up the following equation:

x/2 = 40

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 40 * 2
x = 80

Now let's find out how many salty cookies Paco ate. Since he ate (3y/5) salty cookies and there were 25 salty cookies in total, we can set up the following equation:

3y/5 = 25

To find y, we multiply both sides by 5/3:

y = 25 * (5/3)
y = 125/3
y = 41.666... (which we can round to 42 for the sake of whole cookies)

Now we can find out how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies Paco ate:

More salty cookies than sweet cookies = y - x
More salty cookies than sweet cookies = 42 - 80
More salty cookies than sweet cookies = -38

This result indicates that Paco actually ate 38 more sweet cookies than salty cookies, not the other way around. If we want to find out how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies he ate, we need to consider the negative sign, which indicates that the sweet cookies were more in number. If we want the number of more salty cookies, we should get a positive difference, which is not the case here. Therefore, Paco did not eat more salty cookies than sweet cookies; he ate more sweet cookies than salty cookies.","We have an equation for each type of cookie: 
1. x - the amount of sweet cookies Paco ate, which is related to the total number of 40 sweet cookies as: x = 2 * sweet cookies Paco ate.

2. y - the amount of salty cookies Paco ate, which is related to the total number of 25 salty cookies in the same way: y = 5 * salty cookies Paco ate. 

We also know that Paco ate half the number of sweet cookies and three times the number of salty cookies he ate. So if we find the values of x and y, we can subtract them from each other to get the difference. 

The equations are: 
x = 2 * 20 = 40 
y = 5 * 8 = 40 

Since Paco ate the same number of sweet and salty cookies, the difference is 0. 

**0**","Paco ate (x/2) sweet cookies and (3y/5) salty cookies.

Given that Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies, we can find out how many sweet cookies he ate by dividing the total number of sweet cookies by 2:

x/2 = 40/2
x/2 = 20

So Paco ate 20 sweet cookies.

Now, let's find out how many salty cookies he ate by dividing the total number of salty cookies by 5:

(3y/5) = 25/5
(3y/5) = 5

So Paco ate 5 salty cookies.

Now, let's find out how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies Paco ate:

5 (salty cookies) - 20 (sweet cookies) = -15

If Steven distributes all of his skittles, erasers, and pencils equally into 167 groups and there is a remainder for each item, how many items are in each group, and what would be the remainders for each item?","To find out how many items are in each group and the remainders, we need to divide the total number of each item by the number of groups (167) and find the quotient and remainder.

For skittles:
4502 ÷ 167 = 26 remainder 140
So, there are 26 skittles in each group with 140 skittles left over.

For erasers:
4276 ÷ 167 = 25 remainder 131
So, there are 25 erasers in each group with 131 erasers left over.

For pencils:
3891 ÷ 167 = 23 remainder 100
So, there are 23 pencils in each group with 100 pencils left over.

Therefore, each group would have 26 skittles, 25 erasers, and 23 pencils, with remainders of 140 skittles, 131 erasers, and 100 pencils respectively.","Steven has 78 items in each group, with a remainder of 11 skittles, 113 erasers, and 231 pencils.

The final result is 78.","First, let's find out how many items are in each group.

To do this, we divide the total number of items (skittles, erasers, and pencils) by the number of groups:

Total number of items = 4502 skittles + 4276 erasers + 3891 pencils
Total number of items = 12679

Number of groups = 167

Items per group = Total number of items / Number of groups
Items per group = 12679 / 167
Items per group = 75.5

Since we can't have a fraction of an item, we need to find out how many whole items are in each group and what the remainder would be.

To do this, we divide the total number of items by the number of groups and then take the remainder:

Remainder for skittles = 4502 % 167
Remainder for erasers = 4276 % 167
Remainder for pencils = 3891 % 167

Let's calculate the remainders for each item:

Remainder for skittles = 4502 % 167 = 4502 - (167 * 26) = 4502 - 4358 = 144

Remainder for erasers = 4276 % 167 = 4276 - (167 * 26) = 4276 - 4358 = -92

Remainder for pencils = 3891 % 167 = 3891 - (167 * 23) = 3891 - 3881 = 10

So, there are 75 whole items in each group, with the following remainders:

How many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived?","If only 40% of the trees survived the typhoon, we can calculate the number of trees that survived by taking 40% of the initial 25 trees.

Number of trees that survived = 40% of 25

= 10 trees

Now, to find out how many trees died, we subtract the number of trees that survived from the initial number of trees.

Number of trees that died = Initial number of trees - Number of trees that survived
= 25 - 10
= 15 trees

To find out how many more trees died than those that survived, we subtract the number of trees that survived from the number of trees that died.

More trees died than survived = Number of trees that died - Number of trees that survived
= 15 - 10

A + B + C = 100
53 + 14 + C = 100
67 + C = 100
C = 100 - 67
C = 33

So, Zachary did 53 push-ups, 14 crunches, and 33 squats.

Now, let's find out how many push-ups, crunches, and squats David did:

David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary, so:
Push-ups by David = A + 17 = 53 + 17 = 70

David did 10 less crunches than Zachary, so:
Crunches by David = B - 10 = 14 - 10 = 4

David did twice as many squats as Zachary, so:
Squats by David = 2 * C = 2 * 33 = 66

In summary:
Zachary did 53 push-ups, 14 crunches, and 33 squats.
David did 70 push-ups, 4 crunches, and 66 squats.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We're told that A + B + C = 100, and A = 53, so we can say that B + C = 47. 

2. David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary, so David's push-ups were A + 17 = 70.

3. David did 10 fewer crunches than Zachary, so Zachary's crunches were B = 14. David's crunches would be 14 + 10 = 24.

4. Twice as many squats as Zachary does is C x 2, or simply C + C.

So, for Zachary:
A = 53 push-ups, B = 14 crunches, C = 16 squats.

For David:
A = 70 push-ups, B = 24 crunches, C = 32 squats.

The total amount of exercises is 169.

**169**","Given that A + B + C = 100 and A = 53 and B = 14, we can find the value of C by subtracting A and B from 100:

C = 33

Now we know that Zachary did 53 push-ups, 14 crunches, and 33 squats.

David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 17
David's push-ups = 53 + 17
David's push-ups = 70

David did 10 less crunches than Zachary, so he did:

According to the problem, Rachel had to complete triple the amount of reading homework than history homework. We know she had 20 pages of reading homework, so we can write the following equation:

3H = 20

Now, let's solve for H:

H = 20 / 3
H = 6.67

Since the number of pages of homework can't be a fraction, we can assume that the problem implies that Rachel had to complete 7 pages of history homework (rounding up to the nearest whole number).

Next, the problem states that Rachel had to complete twice the amount of science homework than geography homework. We know she had 15 pages of science homework, so we can write the following equation:

2G = 15

Now, let's solve for G:

G = 15 / 2
G = 7.5

Since the number of pages of homework can't be a fraction, we can assume that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of geography homework (rounding up to the nearest whole number).

Therefore, Rachel had to complete 7 pages of history homework and 8 pages of geography homework.","Rachel had to do 10 pages of history homework and 30 pages of geography homework.

The final result is 40.","Let's denote the number of pages of history homework as H and the number of pages of geography homework as G.

According to the information given, Rachel had to complete triple the amount of reading homework than history homework. This means that the number of pages of reading homework is 3 times the number of pages of history homework. So we can write:

Reading homework = 3 * History homework

We are also told that Rachel had to complete twice the amount of science homework than geography homework. This means that the number of pages of science homework is 2 times the number of pages of geography homework. So we can write:

Science homework = 2 * Geography homework

Now, let's use the information given about the total number of pages of homework to find the number of pages of history and geography homework.

Rachel had to complete 35 pages of math homework, 20 pages of reading homework, and 15 pages of science homework. The total number of pages of homework is:

35 (math homework) + 20 (reading homework) + 15 (science homework) = 70 pages

Now, let's use the equations we have for the reading and science homework to express the number of pages of history and geography homework in terms of H and G:

Reading homework = 3 * History homework
Science homework = 2 * Geography homework

Later, 60% of the customers left, but immediately 10 new customers arrived. After that, the waiter offered a 15% discount on the meals, which attracted 15 new customers. How many customers initially left and how many customers were there in the waiter's area after all the transactions?","Let's solve this step by step.

1. The waiter initially had 12 customers.
2. Some customers left, and then 3 new customers arrived, making the total 8 customers. Let's call the number of customers who left ""x"". So the equation would be:
   12 - x + 3 = 8
   12 - x = 8 - 3
   12 - x = 5
   x = 12 - 5
   x = 7
   So, 7 customers initially left.

3. After that, 60% of the 8 customers left. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   60% of 8 = 0.60 * 8 = 4.8
   Since we can't have a fraction of a customer, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 5 customers who left.

4. Immediately after, 10 new customers arrived. So the new total is:
   8 - 5 + 10 = 3 + 10 = 13 customers

5. Then, a 15% discount attracted 15 new customers, so the final number of customers is:
   13 + 15 = 28 customers

In conclusion, initially, 7 customers left, and after all the transactions, there were 28 customers in the waiter's area.","The waiter initially had 12 customers, and after some left, there were 8 customers remaining, which means 4 customers left the first time. 

Then, 60% of 8 customers left, which equates to 4.8 customers. As we can't have a fraction of a customer, we can assume that 4 customers left the second time, as it's a safe assumption given the earlier information that a whole number of customers left the first time. 

This leaves the waiter with 8 - 4 = 4 customers. 

With the discount, 15 new customers arrived, bringing the total to 19 customers. 

The final result is 19.","Let's denote the number of customers who initially left as \( x \).

After \( x \) customers left, the waiter had \( 12 - x \) customers. Then, 3 new customers arrived, so the number of customers became \( 12 - x + 3 \).

According to the information given, after 3 new customers arrived, the waiter had 8 customers. So we can set up the equation:

\( 12 - x + 3 = 8 \)

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\( 12 - x + 3 = 8 \)
\( 12 - x = 8 - 3 \)
\( 12 - x = 5 \)
\( x = 12 - 5 \)

Cost of chocolates = 3 chocolates * $8/chocolate = $24

Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the total cost of chocolates:

Discount on chocolates = 10% of $24 = 0.10 * $24 = $2.40

So, the total cost of chocolates after the discount is:

Total cost of chocolates after discount = $24 - $2.40 = $21.60

If a total of 60 campers went rowing that day, how many campers went rowing in the morning?","Let's denote the number of campers who went rowing in the morning as 3x, in the afternoon as 2x (since we know that 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon, we can say 2x = 7), and in the evening as 4x.

First, we need to find the value of x. Since 2x = 7, we can solve for x:

2x = 7
x = 7 / 2
x = 3.5

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of campers who went rowing in the morning by multiplying 3x:

Number of campers in the morning = 3x = 3 * 3.5 = 10.5

Since the number of campers cannot be a fraction, we need to re-evaluate our initial assumption that 2x = 7. It seems there might be a mistake because the ratio should be consistent across all groups, and the total number of campers should be an integer.

Let's use the ratio 3:2:4 and the total number of campers (60) to find the correct number of campers who went rowing in the morning.

The total ratio is 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 parts.

If 60 campers went rowing, each part represents 60 / 9 = 6.67 campers. However, since the number of campers must be a whole number, we need to adjust our calculation. The total number of parts should divide the total number of campers (60) evenly.

Let's try again with the correct approach:

The total ratio is 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 parts.

If 60 campers went rowing, each part represents 60 / 9 = 6.67 campers, which is not a whole number. Since we know the ratios must be whole numbers, let's find a multiple of 9 that is less than or equal to 60.

The closest multiple of 9 to 60 is 54 (9 * 6 = 54). This means that each part represents 54 / 9 = 6 campers.

Now, we can find the number of campers who went rowing in the morning by multiplying the value of one part (6 campers) by the ratio for the morning (3 parts):

Number of campers in the morning = 3 parts * 6 campers/part = 18 campers.

Therefore, 18 campers went rowing in the morning.","We have a ratio of 3:2:4 representing the number of campers who went rowing in the morning, afternoon, and evening. The sum of these is 9, and we're told that this number times some unknown value equals 60. We can conclude that 9x = 60, and x = 60 / 9 = 6.75, or 7 campers. 

Therefore, the number of campers rowing in the morning is 3 x 7 = 21. 

Twenty-one.","Let's denote the number of campers who went rowing in the morning as M, in the afternoon as A, and in the evening as E. According to the given ratio, we have:

M : A : E = 3 : 2 : 4

We are also given that the total number of campers who went rowing that day is 60. So we can write:

M + A + E = 60

Now we can express A and E in terms of M using the ratio:

A = 2 * M / 3
E = 4 * M / 3

Substitute these expressions for A and E into the total equation:

M + (2 * M / 3) + (4 * M / 3) = 60

Combine like terms:

M + (2/3)M + (4/3)M = 60
(1 + 2/3 + 4/3)M = 60
(1 + 6/3)M = 60
(7/3)M = 60

Now, solve for M:

M = 60 * (3/7)
M = 20

So, 20 campers went rowing in the morning.",Twenty one,20,18
504,"After resting, they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water at high tide is 15 times Dean's height. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, who stands at 13 feet. If the tide is currently at 75% of its maximum depth and there is an additional current that increases the water depth by 20% of the tide's depth, how deep is the water where they're swimming?","First, let's find out how tall Dean is. We know that Ron is 13 feet tall and Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron. So Dean's height is:

Dean's height = Ron's height + 4 feet
Dean's height = 13 feet + 4 feet
Dean's height = 17 feet

Now, let's find out the maximum depth of the water at high tide, which is 15 times Dean's height:

Maximum depth at high tide = 15 * Dean's height
Maximum depth at high tide = 15 * 17 feet
Maximum depth at high tide = 255 feet

The tide is currently at 75% of its maximum depth, so the current depth of the tide is:

Current tide depth = 75% of maximum depth at high tide
Current tide depth = 0.75 * 255 feet
Current tide depth = 191.25 feet

Now, there is an additional current that increases the water depth by 20% of the tide's depth. So the additional depth due to the current is:

Additional depth due to current = 20% of current tide depth
Additional depth due to current = 0.20 * 191.25 feet
Additional depth due to current = 38.25 feet

Finally, to find the total depth of the water where they're swimming, we add the current tide depth and the additional depth due to the current:

Total water depth = Current tide depth + Additional depth due to current
Total water depth = 191.25 feet + 38.25 feet
Total water depth = 229.5 feet

So, the water where they're swimming is 229.5 feet deep.","Let's solve this together:

1. We know that the depth of the water at high tide is 15 times Dean's height, but we don't know Dean's height yet. Let's call Dean's height x. This means that the water depth at high tide is 15x.

2. We're also told that Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, who stands at 13 feet, so Dean's height is x = 17 feet.

3. Now we can calculate the water depth: at high tide, it would be 15x = 15 × 17 = 255 feet.

4. The tide is currently at 75% of its maximum depth, so that's 255 × 0.75 = 191.25 feet.

5. There's also an additional current that increases the water depth by 20% of the tide's depth: 191.25 × 0.20 = 38.25 feet.

6. Adding the current's depth to the tide's depth gives us a total depth of 191.25 + 38.25 = 230 feet.

Therefore, the final depth of the water where they're swimming is 230 feet.

Ocean.","First, let's find out how tall Dean is. Since Ron is 13 feet tall and Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, Dean is 13 feet + 4 feet = 17 feet tall.

Now, let's find out the depth of the water at high tide. The depth of the water at high tide is 15 times Dean's height, so it is 15 * 17 feet = 255 feet.

The tide is currently at 75% of its maximum depth, so the current depth of the tide is 0.75 * 255 feet = 191.25 feet.

There is an additional current that increases the water depth by 20% of the tide's depth. So, the additional depth is 0.20 * 191.25 feet = 38.25 feet.

Now, let's add the additional depth to the current depth of the tide to find the total depth of the water where they're swimming: 191.25 feet + 38.25 feet = 229.5 feet.

Therefore, the water where they're swimming is 229.5 feet deep.",Ocean,229.5,229.5
505,Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill. Jill has 87 peaches. Tom has twice as many peaches as Steven. How many more peaches does Jake have than Jill after Jake receives 5 peaches from Tom and Jill receives 10 peaches from Tom?,"First, let's find out how many peaches Steven has. Since Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill, and Jill has 87 peaches, we can calculate Steven's peaches as follows:

Steven's peaches = Jill's peaches + 18
Steven's peaches = 87 + 18
Steven's peaches = 105

Now, let's find out how many peaches Jake has. Since Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven, we can calculate Jake's peaches as follows:

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 5
Jake's peaches = 105 - 5
Jake's peaches = 100

Next, let's find out how many peaches Tom has. Since Tom has twice as many peaches as Steven, we can calculate Tom's peaches as follows:

Tom's peaches = 2 * Steven's peaches
Tom's peaches = 2 * 105
Tom's peaches = 210

Now, let's calculate the new number of peaches Jake and Jill have after receiving peaches from Tom. Jake receives 5 peaches from Tom, and Jill receives 10 peaches from Tom.

Jake's new peaches = Jake's original peaches + 5
Jake's new peaches = 100 + 5
Jake's new peaches = 105

Jill's new peaches = Jill's original peaches + 10
Jill's new peaches = 87 + 10
Jill's new peaches = 97

Finally, let's find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill after the exchange:

Jake's peaches - Jill's peaches = 105 - 97
Jake's peaches - Jill's peaches = 8

Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill after the exchange.","Steven has 87 + 18 = 105 peaches.

Tom has 105 x 2 = 210 peaches.

After Jake receives 5 peaches from Tom, he has Tom's peaches - 5 = 205 - 5 = 200 peaches.

After Jill receives 10 peaches from Tom, she has 87 + 10 = 97 peaches.

Jake has 200 - 97 = 103 more peaches than Jill. 

The final result is 103.","Let's start by finding out how many peaches Steven has. Since Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill, and Jill has 87 peaches, Steven has:

87 + 18 = 105 peaches

Now, we know that Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has:

105 - 5 = 100 peaches

Next, we find out how many peaches Tom has. Tom has twice as many peaches as Steven, so Tom has:

105 * 2 = 210 peaches

Now, let's find out how many peaches Jill has after receiving 10 peaches from Tom. Jill will have:

87 + 10 = 97 peaches

Finally, we need to find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill after Jake receives 5 peaches from Tom and Jill receives 10 peaches from Tom. After Jake receives 5 peaches, he will have:

100 + 5 = 105 peaches

After Jill receives 10 peaches, she will have:

97 + 10 = 107 peaches

Now, we compare Jake's number of peaches to Jill's number of peaches after they both receive peaches from Tom:

105 (Jake's peaches) - 107 (Jill's peaches) = -2 more peaches for Jake than Jill.

So, Jake has 2 more peaches than Jill after Jake receives 5 peaches from Tom and Jill receives 10 peaches from Tom.",103,2,8
506,"Adam has 4 shelves in his room, and each shelf can hold a different number of action figures: the first shelf can hold 12 action figures, the second can hold 15, the third can hold 18, and the fourth can hold 9 action figures. He also has 40 cabinets in his room, in which some cabinets have 3 shelves and others have 5 shelves. If each shelf in the 3-shelf cabinets can hold 10 action figures and each shelf in the 5-shelf cabinets can hold 7 action figures, find out the total number of action figures his shelves and cabinets can hold.","First, let's calculate the total number of action figures the shelves in Adam's room can hold:

1st shelf: 12 action figures
2nd shelf: 15 action figures
3rd shelf: 18 action figures
4th shelf: 9 action figures

Total action figures on shelves = 12 + 15 + 18 + 9 = 54 action figures

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures the cabinets can hold. We don't know how many of the 40 cabinets have 3 shelves and how many have 5 shelves, so we can't calculate the exact number of action figures the cabinets can hold. However, we can calculate the maximum and minimum possible number of action figures.

If all 40 cabinets have 3 shelves, each shelf holding 10 action figures:
Total action figures in 3-shelf cabinets = 40 cabinets * 3 shelves/cabinet * 10 action figures/shelf
Total action figures in 3-shelf cabinets = 1200 action figures

If all 40 cabinets have 5 shelves, each shelf holding 7 action figures:
Total action figures in 5-shelf cabinets = 40 cabinets * 5 shelves/cabinet * 7 action figures/shelf
Total action figures in 5-shelf cabinets = 1400 action figures

Since we don't know the distribution of the cabinets, the total number of action figures the cabinets can hold will be somewhere between 1200 and 1400 action figures.

Now, let's add the number of action figures the shelves can hold to the minimum and maximum possible numbers for the cabinets:

Minimum total = 54 (shelves) + 1200 (3-shelf cabinets) = 1254 action figures
Maximum total = 54 (shelves) + 1400 (5-shelf cabinets) = 1454 action figures

Therefore, the total number of action figures Adam's shelves and cabinets can hold is between 1254 and 1454 action figures.","Let's first find the total number of action figures that can be held by Adam's shelves. The first shelf holds 12 figures, the second holds 15, the third holds 18, and the fourth holds 9, giving a total of 12 + 15 + 18 + 9 = 54 action figures.

Now, let's consider the cabinets. Some cabinets have 3 shelves, and some have 5. The 3-shelf cabinets can hold 3 * 10 = 30 action figures in total, while the 5-shelf cabinets hold 5 * 7 = 35 action figures.

Since we don't know how many of each cabinet Adam has, we'll assume that he has an equal number of both. If he has the same number of 3-shelf and 5-shelf cabinets, the total number of action figures his cabinets can hold is (30 + 35) / 2 = 32.5. We'll round this number up to 33, as it's not possible to have half an action figure. 

Adding the total number of figures from the shelves and cabinets gives us 54 + 33 = 87 action figures. 

The final result is 87.","First, let's calculate the total number of action figures the shelves can hold:

- The first shelf can hold 12 action figures.
- The second shelf can hold 15 action figures.
- The third shelf can hold 18 action figures.
- The fourth shelf can hold 9 action figures.

Now, let's add up the action figures from all the shelves:

Total action figures from shelves = 12 (first shelf) + 15 (second shelf) + 18 (third shelf) + 9 (fourth shelf)
Total action figures from shelves = 54

Next, let's calculate the total number of action figures the cabinets can hold:

- There are 40 cabinets in total.
- Some cabinets have 3 shelves, and others have 5 shelves.
- Each shelf in the 3-shelf cabinets can hold 10 action figures.
- Each shelf in the 5-shelf cabinets can hold 7 action figures.

Now, let's calculate the total action figures from the cabinets:

Total action figures from cabinets with 3 shelves = 3 shelves/cabinet * 10 action figures/shelf * 40 cabinets
Total action figures from cabinets with 3 shelves = 3 * 10 * 40
Total action figures from cabinets with 3 shelves = 120 * 40
Total action figures from cabinets with 3 shelves = 4800

Total action figures from cabinets with 5 shelves = 5 shelves/cabinet * 7 action figures/shelf * 40 cabinets
Total action figures from cabinets with 5 shelves = 5 * 7 * 40
Total action figures from cabinets with 5 shelves = 140 * 40
Total action figures from cabinets with 5 shelves = 5600

Now, let's add up the action figures from all the cabinets:

Total action figures from cabinets = Total action figures from cabinets with 3 shelves + Total action figures from cabinets with 5 shelves
Total action figures from cabinets = 4800 + 5600
Total action figures from cabinets = 10400

Finally, let's add up the action figures from the shelves and cabinets to get the total number of action figures:

Total action figures = Total action figures from shelves + Total action figures from cabinets

On the first shelf:
Initially, Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures.
He added 1.5 more books and 2 more action figures.

Now, let's calculate the new total after the discount on the candy bar:

Total after discount = $6.30 (candy bar with discount) + $6 (chocolate) + $3 (pack of gum) + $4 (bag of chips) = $19.30

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the total amount spent:

5% tax on $19.30 = 5/100 * $19.30 = $0.965

Since tax is usually rounded to the nearest cent, the tax would be $0.97.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent including the discount and tax:

Total with discount and tax = $19.30 (total after discount) + $0.97 (tax) = $20.27

So, Dan spent $20.27 buying all the items, including the discount and tax.","Dan's total comes to $21.40.

He spent $7 on the candy bar, $6 on chocolate, $3 on gum, and $4 on chips. With the 10% discount on the candy bar, that's $6.30 saved. So, the total before tax is $17.70.
For the 5% tax, multiply $17.70 by 0.05 which equals $0.885. Adding the tax to the total, Dan spent $18.585. We can round this amount to the nearest ten cents, which gives us $18.60.

The final result is: **EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS**.","First, let's calculate the total amount Dan spent on the items before the discount and tax:

Candy bar: $7
Chocolate: $6
Pack of gum: $3
Bag of chips: $4

Total amount spent on items = $7 + $6 + $3 + $4 = $20

Now, let's calculate the discount on the candy bar:

Discount on candy bar = 10% of $7 = 0.10 * $7 = $0.70

Next, let's calculate the tax on the total amount spent:

Tax on total amount spent = 5% of $20 = 0.05 * $20 = $1.00

Now, let's add the discount and tax to the total amount spent on the items:

Total amount spent including discount and tax = $20 + $0.70 + $1.00 = $21.70

So, Dan spent $21.70 buying all the items, including the discount and tax.",EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS,Twenty One Seventy.,Twenty dollars and twenty-seven cents.
513,"Carol was sending out birthday invitations to her friends. Each package of invitations she bought had 5 invitations in it and she bought 3 packs. If she wants to invite 23 friends, how many extra invitations will she need to buy?","Carol bought 3 packs of invitations, with each pack containing 5 invitations. So, she has a total of 3 packs * 5 invitations per pack = 15 invitations.

She wants to invite 23 friends, so she needs 23 invitations in total.

She already has 15 invitations, so she needs an additional 23 invitations - 15 invitations = 8 invitations.

Since each pack contains 5 invitations and she needs 8 more, she will have to buy at least 2 more packs to have enough invitations. Buying 2 more packs will give her 2 packs * 5 invitations per pack = 10 invitations.

After buying 2 more packs, she will have 15 original invitations + 10 additional invitations = 25 invitations.

Therefore, she will have 25 invitations - 23 friends = 2 extra invitations after buying the additional packs.","Carol has a total of 15 invitations from her current stock because 3 x 5 = 15. 
She needs 23 invitations in total, so she requires 23 - 15 = 8 more invitations.

514,"The grasshopper, the frog, the mouse, and the rabbit had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper. The rabbit jumped twice the grasshopper's jump, minus 5 inches. How much farther did the rabbit jump than the mouse?","Let's calculate the jump distances for each animal step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches.

2. The frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog's jump was:
   Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 37 inches
   Frog's jump = 14 inches + 37 inches
   Frog's jump = 51 inches

3. The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's jump was:
   Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 16 inches
   Mouse's jump = 51 inches - 16 inches
   Mouse's jump = 35 inches

4. The rabbit jumped twice the grasshopper's jump, minus 5 inches, so the rabbit's jump was:
   Rabbit's jump = (2 × Grasshopper's jump) - 5 inches
   Rabbit's jump = (2 × 14 inches) - 5 inches
   Rabbit's jump = 28 inches - 5 inches
   Rabbit's jump = 23 inches

Now, to find out how much farther the rabbit jumped than the mouse, we subtract the mouse's jump from the rabbit's jump:
   Difference = Rabbit's jump - Mouse's jump
   Difference = 23 inches - 35 inches
   Difference = -12 inches

This means the rabbit actually jumped 12 inches less than the mouse, not farther.","Let's analyze and solve the word problem step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches.

2. The frog jumped 37 inches - 16 inches = 21 inches more than the mouse.

3. The rabbit jumped 14 inches x 2 - 5 inches = 23 inches more than the grasshopper.

4. So, the mouse jumped 21 inches - 23 inches = **12 inches** less than the rabbit.

The rabbit jumped 12 inches farther than the mouse.","Let's denote the frog's jump as F inches. According to the information given, the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's jump is F - 16 inches.

The grasshopper jumped 14 inches, and the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog's jump is 14 + 37 = 51 inches.

Now, we know that the rabbit jumped twice the grasshopper's jump, minus 5 inches. So the rabbit's jump is 2 * 14 - 5 = 26 inches.

To find out how much farther the rabbit jumped than the mouse, we subtract the mouse's jump from the rabbit's jump:

26 (rabbit's jump) - (F - 16) (mouse's jump) = 26 - (F - 16)

Now, we need to find the value of F that makes this equation true. Since we know the frog jumped 51 inches, we can substitute F = 51 into the equation:

26 - (51 - 16) = 26 - 35 = -9

This result doesn't make sense because the rabbit's jump cannot be less than the mouse's jump. We have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our math.

The grasshopper jumped 14 inches, and the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog's jump is 14 + 37 = 51 inches.

The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's jump is 51 - 16 = 35 inches.

The rabbit jumped twice the grasshopper's jump, minus 5 inches. So the rabbit's jump is 2 * 14 - 5 = 26 inches.

Now, we subtract the mouse's jump from the rabbit's jump to find out how much farther the rabbit jumped than the mouse:

26 (rabbit's jump) - 35 (mouse's jump) = 26 - 35 = -9

Again, this result doesn't make sense because the rabbit's jump cannot be less than the mouse's jump. We have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's check our math again.

The grasshopper jumped 14 inches, and the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog's jump is 14 + 37 = 51 inches.

The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's jump is 51 - 16 = 35 inches.

515,"In a bird sanctuary, there were initially 8 storks, 4 herons, and 5 sparrows sitting on various fences. Then, 3 storks and 2 herons flew away, while 4 sparrows and 2 hummingbirds arrived. How many more storks than the total of all other bird species are sitting in the sanctuary now?","Initially, there were:
- 8 storks
- 4 herons
- 5 sparrows

After some birds flew away and others arrived, we have:
- Storks: 8 (initial) - 3 (flew away) = 5 storks remaining
- Herons: 4 (initial) - 2 (flew away) = 2 herons remaining
- Sparrows: 5 (initial) + 4 (arrived) = 9 sparrows remaining
- Hummingbirds: 0 (initial) + 2 (arrived) = 2 hummingbirds

Now, let's find the total number of all other bird species:
- Total of other species = Herons + Sparrows + Hummingbirds
- Total of other species = 2 (herons) + 9 (sparrows) + 2 (hummingbirds)
- Total of other species = 2 + 9 + 2
- Total of other species = 13

Now, let's find out how many more storks there are than the total of all other bird species:
- More storks than other species = Number of storks - Total of other species
- More storks than other species = 5 (storks) - 13 (other species)
- More storks than other species = -8

However, since we cannot have a negative number of birds, this means that there are actually 8 fewer storks than the total of all other bird species in the sanctuary now.","There are 3 steps to solve this problem:

1. First, we find the total number of birds that are not storks: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11

2. Then, we subtract the number of birds that flew away from this total: 11 - (3 + 2) = 6

3. Finally, we subtract the number of storks from the number of birds that remained, to find the difference: 8 - 6 = 2

**2**","Initially, there were 8 storks, 4 herons, and 5 sparrows, which makes a total of 8 + 4 + 5 = 17 birds.

Then, 3 storks and 2 herons flew away, so the number of storks became 8 - 3 = 5 and the number of herons became 4 - 2 = 2.

After that, 4 sparrows and 2 hummingbirds arrived, so the number of sparrows became 5 + 4 = 9 and the number of hummingbirds became 2.

Now, there are 5 storks, 2 herons, 9 sparrows, and 2 hummingbirds, which makes a total of 5 + 2 + 9 + 2 = 18 birds.

To find out how many more storks there are than the total of all other bird species, we subtract the total number of other bird species from the number of storks:

5 (storks) - (2 (herons) + 9 (sparrows) + 2 (hummingbirds)) = 5 - (2 + 9 + 2) = 5 - 13 = -8.

For the remaining 48 trees, assume the average number of apples is X per tree. What is the total number of apples remaining on all of her trees?","First, let's calculate the total number of apples remaining on the first four trees:

1st tree: 10 apples remaining
2nd tree: 40 apples remaining
3rd tree: 15 apples remaining
4th tree: 22 apples remaining

Total remaining on the first four trees = 10 + 40 + 15 + 22 = 87 apples

Now, for the remaining 48 trees, we assume an average of X apples per tree. Therefore, the total number of apples remaining on these 48 trees would be:

48 trees * X apples/tree = 48X apples

To find the total number of apples remaining on all 52 trees, we add the apples remaining on the first four trees to the total for the remaining 48 trees:

Total remaining on all trees = 87 apples (from the first four trees) + 48X apples (from the remaining 48 trees)
Total remaining on all trees = 87 + 48X

Without the value of X, we cannot calculate the exact total number of apples remaining. However, the expression for the total number of apples remaining on all trees is 87 + 48X.","Rachel has 52 trees, and we found out the number of apples for 4 of them. We'll call these trees A, B, C, and D, which have 10, 40, 15, and 22 apples remaining, respectively. We need to determine the average number of apples for the other 48 trees.

We can calculate the total number of apples from these four trees by adding them together: 10 + 40 + 15 + 22 = 87 apples.

We also know the total number of apples picked from these four trees: 16 + 25 + 43 + 8 = 92 apples.

The difference between the total apples picked and the total apples remaining gives us the number of apples that were on these four trees originally: 92 - 87 = 5 apples.

So, each of the 48 other trees has an average of 5 apples originally.

The number of apples remaining on these 48 trees is therefore: 48 × 5 = 240 apples.

Adding the apples from the four trees we counted separately, Rachel has a total of 87 + 240 = **327** apples remaining.","First, let's find out how many apples were picked from each tree:

- 1st tree: 10 apples remaining
- 2nd tree: 40 apples remaining
- 3rd tree: 15 apples remaining

Next, we need to find the total number of apples remaining on the 48 trees. Since we are assuming the average number of apples per tree is X, we can calculate the total number of apples remaining by multiplying the average number of apples per tree by the number of trees.

However, we need to be careful because the 48 trees include the 4 trees that have already been picked, so we need to subtract those 4 trees from the total number of trees.

Total number of trees = 52 (original number of trees) - 4 (trees already picked) = 48 trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples remaining:

Total number of apples remaining = Average number of apples per tree × Number of trees

How many more children got off the bus in total than those that got on at both stops?","Let's calculate the number of children on the bus after each stop.

Originally, there were 36 children on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 45 children got off and 25 got on. So the number of children on the bus after the first stop is:
36 (original) - 45 (got off) + 25 (got on) = 36 - 45 + 25 = -9 + 25 = 16 children.

At the second bus stop, 68 children got off and an unknown number got on. After this stop, there were 12 children on the bus. So the number of children on the bus after the second stop is:
16 (from the first stop) - 68 (got off) + x (got on) = 12
16 - 68 + x = 12
-52 + x = 12
x = 12 + 52
x = 64 children got on at the second stop.

Total got off = 45 (first stop) + 68 (second stop) = 113 children.
Total got on = 25 (first stop) + 64 (second stop) = 89 children.

To find out how many more children got off the bus in total than those that got on at both stops, we subtract the total number that got on from the total number that got off:
113 (got off) - 89 (got on) = 24 more children got off the bus in total than those that got on.","First, we learn that after the first stop, the number of children on the bus increased by 25, changing from 36 to 61. After the second stop, we don't have the exact number of children who got on the bus, but we do know that there were 53 children left on the bus after this second exchange, because 68 children got off, and there were originally 12 children remaining on the bus. We can subtract this remaining number of children from the number of children after the first stop to find the difference: 

61 - 53 = 8

At the second stop, 68 children got off the bus. To find out how many children got on at the second stop, we subtract the number of children who got off at the second stop from the number of children who were on the bus after the first stop:

16 (number of children after the first stop) - 68 (children who got off at the second stop) = -52

Since the number of children who got on at the second stop cannot be negative, we need to correct our calculation. The number of children who got on at the second stop is actually:

This means that Zachary actually did 30 fewer push-ups than the combined amount of David and Emily, not more.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Zachary did 51 push-ups, David 44, and Emily 37. We add these together: 51 + 44 + 37 = 132 push-ups.

2. Now, we subtract David and Emily's total from Zachary's score: 51 - 132 = -81.

Zachary did negative eighty-one push-ups more than David and Emily combined.

-81","To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than the combined amount of David and Emily, we first need to add the number of push-ups David and Emily did together.

David did 44 push-ups, and Emily did 37 push-ups. So, we add these two numbers together:

44 (David's push-ups) + 37 (Emily's push-ups) = 81 (combined push-ups)

Now, we subtract the combined amount of push-ups David and Emily did from the number of push-ups Zachary did to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did:

51 (Zachary's push-ups) - 81 (combined push-ups) = -30

Zachary did 30 more push-ups than the combined amount of David and Emily.",-81,30,fewer

Eight.","First, we need to find out how many crackers and cakes each of Matthew's 15 friends will receive.

To do this, we divide the total number of crackers and cakes by the number of friends:

Crackers per friend = 45 crackers ÷ 15 friends = 3 crackers per friend
Cakes per friend = 68 cakes ÷ 15 friends = 4.53 cakes per friend

Since we can't give a fraction of a cake, we'll have to adjust the number of cakes each friend gets. To do this, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 4 cakes per friend.

Over the course of the week, she went shopping and spent some money on clothes, then received some extra money as a late birthday gift, and finally spent some more money on books. By the end of the week, she had 345 dollars left. How much money did Gwen spend in total on clothes and books, and how much money did she receive as a late birthday gift?","Let's denote the amount of money Gwen spent on clothes as C and the amount she spent on books as B. Let's also denote the amount of money she received as a late birthday gift as G.

Initially, Gwen had 300 dollars. After spending on clothes, she had 300 - C dollars. Then she received a late birthday gift, increasing her total to (300 - C) + G dollars. Finally, after spending on books, she had (300 - C + G) - B dollars left.

According to the information given, by the end of the week, Gwen had 345 dollars left. So we can set up the following equation:

(300 - C + G) - B = 345

Now, we need to find out how much Gwen spent in total on clothes and books (C + B) and how much she received as a late birthday gift (G).

To find the total amount spent on clothes and books, we can rearrange the equation to isolate C + B:

C + B = 300 + G - 345

Since we know that Gwen had 345 dollars at the end of the week, we can substitute this value into the equation:

C + B = 300 + G - 345
C + B = G - 45

Now, we need to find the value of G to determine the total amount spent. However, we don't have enough information to find the exact values of C, B, and G individually. We can only express the total amount spent (C + B) in terms of the late birthday gift (G).

If we want to find the total amount spent and the late birthday gift, we need additional information, such as the exact amounts spent on clothes or books or the exact amount of the late birthday gift. Without this information, we can't determine the exact amounts.","Gwen spent a total of $55 on clothes and books. She received $45 as a late birthday gift.

$55.","Let's denote the amount of money Gwen spent on clothes as C, the amount of money she received as a late birthday gift as G, and the amount of money she spent on books as B.

We know that by the end of the week, Gwen had 345 dollars left. This means that the total amount of money she had after spending on clothes, receiving the late birthday gift, and spending on books is 345 dollars.

We also know that initially, Gwen had 300 dollars. So, the total amount of money she had after spending on clothes, receiving the late birthday gift, and spending on books is the initial amount of money plus the late birthday gift:

345 = 300 + G

Now, let's solve for G:

345 = 300 + G
G = 345 - 300
G = 45

So, Gwen received 45 dollars as a late birthday gift.

Now, let's find out how much money Gwen spent in total on clothes and books. We know that she had 345 dollars left, and we've already calculated that she received 45 dollars as a late birthday gift. So, the total amount of money she had after spending on clothes and books is:

345 - 45 = 300

How many more communications did Jack receive in the morning than in the afternoon?","To find out how many more communications Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon, we first need to calculate the total number of communications he received in the morning and then in the afternoon.

Morning communications:
10 emails + 12 letters + 25 texts + 4 phone calls = 10 + 12 + 25 + 4 = 51 communications

Afternoon communications:
3 emails + 44 letters + 15 texts + 6 phone calls = 3 + 44 + 15 + 6 = 68 communications

Now, we subtract the afternoon communications from the morning communications to find out how many more he received in the morning:

Morning communications - Afternoon communications = 51 - 68 = -17

Since the result is negative, it means Jack actually received more communications in the afternoon than in the morning. To express how many more he received in the afternoon, we take the absolute value of the result:

|-17| = 17

So, Jack received 17 more communications in the afternoon than in the morning.","In the morning, Jack received 10 + 12 + 25 + 4 = 41 communications. In the afternoon, Jack received 3 + 44 + 15 + 6 = 68 communications.

Afterward, they exchanged C apps between them. After all these operations, Dave had 4 apps left on his phone, and Sarah had F apps left on her phone. Determine the values of X, Y, A, B, D, E, C, and F if all variables represent whole numbers and you are given that F > 4.","Let's break down the operations step by step and create equations based on the information given:

1. Dave starts with X apps and adds A new apps: \( X + A \)
2. Dave then deletes D apps: \( X + A - D \)
3. Dave exchanges C apps with Sarah: \( X + A - D - C \)
4. After all operations, Dave has 4 apps left: \( X + A - D - C = 4 \) (Equation 1)

For Sarah:
1. Sarah starts with Y apps and adds B new apps: \( Y + B \)
2. Sarah then deletes E apps: \( Y + B - E \)
3. Sarah exchanges C apps with Dave: \( Y + B - E + C \)
4. After all operations, Sarah has F apps left: \( Y + B - E + C = F \) (Equation 2)

We also know that \( F > 4 \).

Now, let's solve the system of equations:

From Equation 1:
\( X + A - D - C = 4 \)
\( X = 4 + D + C - A \) (Equation 3)

From Equation 2:
\( Y + B - E + C = F \)
\( Y = F + E - B - C \) (Equation 4)

Since all variables represent whole numbers, we can try to find a set of values that satisfy both equations and the condition \( F > 4 \). However, without additional information or constraints, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations. We can choose any values for A, B, C, D, and E that are whole numbers and then solve for X and Y using Equations 3 and 4, ensuring that F is greater than 4.

For example, let's arbitrarily choose values for A, B, C, D, and E:
A = 1, B = 1, C = 1, D = 1, E = 1

Using Equation 3:
\( X = 4 + D + C - A \)
\( X = 4 + 1 + 1 - 1 \)
\( X = 5 \)

Using Equation 4 and choosing F = 5 (since F must be greater than 4):
\( Y = F + E - B - C \)
\( Y = 5 + 1 - 1 - 1 \)
\( Y = 4 \)

So, one possible solution set is:
X = 5, Y = 4, A = 1, B = 1, C = 1, D = 1, E = 1, F = 5

But remember, there are infinitely many solutions, and this is just one example.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We're given the final number of apps Dave has: Dave = 4
2. We know that Sarah has more apps than Dave after the operations: Sarah > Dave

- X = 10
- Y = 15
- A = 5
- B = 3
- D = 2
- E = 1
- C = 3

4. Now let's calculate the final number of apps for Sarah:
- F = Y + B - E + C = 15 + 3 - 1 + 3 = 18

- X = the number of apps Dave originally had
- Y = the number of apps Sarah originally had
- A = the number of new apps Dave added
- B = the number of new apps Sarah added
- D = the number of apps Dave deleted
- E = the number of apps Sarah deleted
- C = the number of apps they exchanged
- F = the number of apps Sarah had left

We are given that F > 4, which means Sarah had more than 4 apps left after the exchange.

We also know that after all operations, Dave had 4 apps left on his phone.

Let's start by calculating the total number of apps Dave had after adding and deleting apps:

Dave's total apps = X + A - D

We don't have the values of X, A, D, or C, but we can express them in terms of Y, B, E, and F:

Dave's total apps = Y + B - E + C

Now, let's express Dave's total apps in terms of F:

Dave's total apps = Y + B - E + C = F - 4

So, we have:

Y + B - E + C = F - 4

Now, let's solve for Y:

Y = F - 4 - B + E - C

Since we don't have the values of B, E, or C, we can't determine Y yet. However, we can express Y in terms of F, B, E, and C:

Y = F - 4 - B + E - C

Now, let's consider the total number of apps Sarah had after adding and deleting apps:

Sarah's total apps = Y + B - E

We can express this in terms of F:

Sarah's total apps = Y + B - E = F - E

Now, let's solve for Y:

Y = F - E

So, we have:

Y = F - E

Now, let's consider the total number of apps Sarah had after the exchange:

Sarah's total apps after exchange = Y - C

We can express this in terms of F:

Sarah's total apps after exchange = Y - C = F - 4 - C

Now, let's solve for Y:

Y = F - 4 - C

So, we have:

Y = F - 4 - C

Now, let's consider the total number of apps Dave had after the exchange:

Dave's total apps after exchange = Dave's total apps - C

Dave also originally had 21 files and deleted some, leaving him with 7 files. However, he then transferred 4 of those remaining files to another device. To find out how many files he deleted, we first need to add back the 4 files he transferred, to get the number of files he had before transferring:

7 files (remaining) + 4 files (transferred) = 11 files (before transferring)

Now we can find out how many files he deleted by subtracting the number of files he had before transferring from the original number of files:

21 files (original) - 11 files (before transferring) = 10 files (deleted)

Tomatoes:
He started with 500 tomatoes and picked 325.
500 - 325 = 175 tomatoes left.

Potatoes:
He started with 400 potatoes and picked 270.
400 - 270 = 130 potatoes left.

Cucumbers:
He started with 300 cucumbers and didn't pick any, but he planted 200 new cucumber plants, each yielding two cucumbers.
So, the new cucumbers added are 200 plants * 2 cucumbers/plant = 400 cucumbers.
300 (original) + 400 (new) = 700 cucumbers in total.

Cabbages:
He started with 100 cabbages and picked 50.
100 - 50 = 50 cabbages left.

So, the new cabbages added are 80 plants * 3 cabbages/plant = 240 cabbages.
50 (remaining after picking) + 240 (new) = 290 cabbages in total.

In summary, after these operations, the farmer has:

The farmer initially has:
- 500 tomatoes
- 400 potatoes

- 270 potatoes minus 400 initially = -130 potatoes
- 50 cabbages minus 100 initially = -50 cabbages

The new plants' yield:
- 200 cucumber plants x 2 cucumbers each = 400 cucumbers
- 80 cabbage plants x 3 cabbages each = 240 cabbages

Now, we calculate the final sum:
- Tomatoes: -175 + 325 = 150
- Potatoes: -130 + 270 = 140
- Cucumbers: 300 + 400 = 700
- Cabbages: -50 + 240 = 190

534,"The Razorback t-shirt shop sells t-shirts at $51 and hats at $28 each. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game, they offered discount on all the items. T-shirts were discounted by $8 each and hats by $5 each. During the game, they sold 130 t-shirts and 85 hats. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts and hats?","First, let's calculate the discounted price for each item:

Discounted price of t-shirts = Original price of t-shirts - Discount on t-shirts
Discounted price of t-shirts = $51 - $8
Discounted price of t-shirts = $43

Discounted price of hats = Original price of hats - Discount on hats
Discounted price of hats = $28 - $5
Discounted price of hats = $23

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the t-shirts and hats:

Revenue from t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold * Discounted price of t-shirts
Revenue from t-shirts = 130 * $43
Revenue from t-shirts = $5590

Revenue from hats = Number of hats sold * Discounted price of hats
Revenue from hats = 85 * $23
Revenue from hats = $1955

Total revenue = Revenue from t-shirts + Revenue from hats
Total revenue = $5590 + $1955
Total revenue = $7545

The Razorback t-shirt shop made $7545 from selling the t-shirts and hats during the game.","Let's solve this problem step by step:
1. The original price of the t-shirts is $51, and after the discount, they cost $51 - $8 = $43.
2. The original price of the hats is $28, and after the discount, they cost $28 - $5 = $23.
3. Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the t-shirts and hats.
3.1 For the t-shirts: $43 x 130 = $5590
3.2 For the hats: $23 x 85 = $1955
4. Combining the revenue from both items, we get a total of $5590 + $1955 = $7545

So, the final answer is **$7545**.","To calculate the total amount of money made from selling the t-shirts and hats, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by the discounted price and then add the two amounts together.

For the t-shirts:
Discounted price per t-shirt = $51 - $8 = $43
Number of t-shirts sold = 130
Total amount from t-shirts = $43 * 130 = $5590

For the hats:
Discounted price per hat = $28 - $5 = $23
Number of hats sold = 85
Total amount from hats = $23 * 85 = $1925

Now, we add the total amount from the t-shirts and the hats together:
Total amount = $5590 (from t-shirts) + $1925 (from hats) = $7515

So, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $7515 from selling the t-shirts and hats during the Arkansas and Texas tech game.",7545,7515,7545
535,"A grocery store had 130 bottles of regular soda, 88 bottles of diet soda, 65 bottles of sparkling water, 47 bottles of orange juice, and 27 bottles of cranberry juice. In addition, there were 102 apples, 88 oranges, 74 bananas, and 45 pears in the store.

Total bottles = 130 + 88 + 65 + 47 + 27
Total bottles = 357

To find the total number of fruits, we add up all the fruits:

Apples: 102
Oranges: 88
Bananas: 74
Pears: 45

Total fruits = 102 + 88 + 74 + 45
Total fruits = 309

Now, to find the total number of bottles and fruits, we add the total number of bottles to the total number of fruits:

Total bottles and fruits = Total bottles + Total fruits
Total bottles and fruits = 357 + 309
Total bottles and fruits = 666

Therefore, the grocery store had a total of 666 bottles and fruits.","Let's calculate the total number of bottles and fruits:
1. We have 130 + 88 + 65 + 47 + 27 = 357 bottles in total.
2. There are 102 + 88 + 74 + 45 = 269 fruits in total.

On the other hand, pupils were divided into three groups with 65 arriving in the morning, 57 arriving in the mid-day, and 55 arriving in the evening. Determine the total number of seating sessions required to accommodate everyone and how many people attended each seating session.","To determine the total number of seating sessions required, we need to calculate the number of sessions needed for both parents and pupils separately, and then add them together.

For parents:
- Morning session: 35 parents
- Afternoon session: 26 parents

Since the program can seat 44 people at a time, all 35 parents in the morning session can be accommodated in one seating session. The 26 parents in the afternoon session can also be accommodated in one seating session.

Total seating sessions for parents = 1 (morning) + 1 (afternoon) = 2 sessions

For pupils:
- Morning group: 65 pupils
- Mid-day group: 57 pupils
- Evening group: 55 pupils

Each group will need to be divided into sessions that can accommodate 44 people at a time.

Morning group: 65 pupils will need 2 sessions (44 in the first session, and 21 in the second session).
Mid-day group: 57 pupils will need 2 sessions (44 in the first session, and 13 in the second session).
Evening group: 55 pupils will need 2 sessions (44 in the first session, and 11 in the second session).

Total seating sessions for pupils = 2 (morning) + 2 (mid-day) + 2 (evening) = 6 sessions

Now, we add the total seating sessions for parents and pupils together:

Total seating sessions required = 2 (parents) + 6 (pupils) = 8 sessions

To determine how many people attended each seating session, we can list them as follows:

Parents:
- Morning session: 35 parents
- Afternoon session: 26 parents

Pupils:
- Morning session 1: 44 pupils
- Morning session 2: 21 pupils
- Mid-day session 1: 44 pupils
- Mid-day session 2: 13 pupils
- Evening session 1: 44 pupils
- Evening session 2: 11 pupils

- As for the pupils, three sessions are required corresponding to their three arrival times. The attendance is 65 in the morning, 57 at midday, and 55 in the evening.

Therefore, five seating sessions are needed in total. Each session would have 44 attendees.

**Five**","First, let's calculate the total number of parents and pupils who participated in the program:

Parents: 35 (morning) + 26 (afternoon) = 61
Pupils: 65 (morning) + 57 (mid-day) + 55 (evening) = 177

Now, let's calculate the total number of seating sessions required to accommodate everyone:

Total number of parents = 61
Total number of pupils = 177
Total number of people = 61 (parents) + 177 (pupils) = 238

The program can seat 44 people at a time, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people per seating session:

238 (total number of people) ÷ 44 (people per seating session) = 5.404040404040404

Since we can't have a fraction of a seating session, we'll need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, we'll need 6 seating sessions to accommodate everyone.

Since each shelf contains 2 books, the total number of books that can be placed on 3 shelves is 2 books/shelf * 3 shelves = 6 books.

Now, we know that Bryan has a total of 42 books, so the number of shelves needed to accommodate all the books is 42 books / 6 books/shelf = 7 shelves.

Since each shelf also contains 1 decorative item, the total number of decorative items needed for 7 shelves is 1 decoration/shelf * 7 shelves = 7 decorations.

Therefore, the ratio of books to decorations in this arrangement is 42 books : 7 decorations, which simplifies to 6:1.","Bryan has 14 books and 2 decorative items in this arrangement.

The ratio is 7:2 or 7 to 2.","Bryan has 42 books in total. If he wants to arrange them so that each bookshelf contains 2 books and 1 decorative item, we need to find out how many bookshelves he will need.

First, let's find out how many bookshelves are needed to fit the books. Since each bookshelf holds 2 books, we divide the total number of books by 2 to get the number of bookshelves:

42 books ÷ 2 books per shelf = 21 bookshelves

Now, we know that Bryan needs 21 bookshelves to fit the books. However, we are also told that it takes exactly 3 shelves to fit the books and decorations. This means that the number of bookshelves needed to fit the books is equal to the number of shelves needed to fit the books and decorations.

Since Bryan has 42 books and 3 shelves, we can find out the total number of decorative items by subtracting the number of bookshelves from the number of shelves:

3 shelves - 21 bookshelves = 1 shelf

Now, we know that Bryan has 1 shelf for decorative items. Since each shelf holds 1 decorative item, we can find the total number of decorative items by multiplying the number of shelves by the number of decorative items per shelf:

1 shelf × 1 decorative item per shelf = 1 decorative item

Now, we have the total number of books (42) and the total number of decorative items (1). To find the ratio of books to decorations, we divide the number of books by the number of decorative items:

Now, let's find out how many of each type of card she has left after giving some away:

Baseball cards left:
438 - 219 = 219 baseball cards

Ace cards left:
18 - 6 = 12 Ace cards

Next, let's account for the trade she made:

She traded away 52 Pokemon cards, so she has:
312 - 52 = 260 Pokemon cards left

The ratio is:
Baseball cards : Ace cards : Pokemon cards
219 : 49 : 260

To simplify the ratio, we can divide each number by the greatest common divisor of the three numbers, which is 1 in this case, so the ratio remains the same:

219 : 49 : 260

Therefore, Nell has 170 more baseball cards than Ace cards, and the ratio of her baseball cards to Ace cards to Pokemon cards is 219:49:260.","Nell initially has 438 baseball cards, 18 Ace cards, and 312 Pokemon cards.

- 10 campers went rowing only in the evening.

First, let's find out how many campers went rowing in the afternoon but not in the morning or evening. We know that 11 campers who went in the morning also went in the afternoon, so we subtract those from the total afternoon campers:

34 (afternoon) - 11 (morning and afternoon) = 23 campers who went in the afternoon but not in the morning.

Now, we need to subtract the 20 campers who went in the afternoon and evening from the 23 we just calculated:

23 (afternoon only) - 20 (afternoon and evening) = 3 campers who went in the afternoon but not in the morning or evening.

Now, let's find out how many unique campers went rowing in the evening. We know that 20 campers went in the afternoon and evening, and 10 went only in the evening:

20 (afternoon and evening) + 10 (evening only) = 30 unique campers who went rowing in the evening.

Now, let's find the total number of unique campers who went rowing in the afternoon. We have 11 who went in the morning and afternoon, 20 who went in the afternoon and evening, and 3 who went in the afternoon only:

11 (morning and afternoon) + 20 (afternoon and evening) + 3 (afternoon only) = 34 unique campers who went rowing in the afternoon.

Finally, we compare the unique campers in the afternoon to those in the evening:

34 (afternoon) - 30 (evening) = 4 more unique campers went rowing in the afternoon than in the evening.","Let's solve this together!

3. A - B = 20 (campers who went rowing in the afternoon but not in the evening)

Now, we need to find the number of unique campers who went rowing in the afternoon but not in the evening. This is given by the difference between the total number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon and the number of campers who went rowing only in the evening.

So, A - B = 20, which means that 20 unique campers went rowing in the afternoon but not in the evening.

Now, let's find the total number of unique campers who went rowing in the afternoon and the evening. This is given by the sum of the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon and the number of campers who went rowing only in the evening.

In addition to these losses, Helen received a surprise gift of 45 cookies from her friend Lucy. Considering all these events, how many cookies are available at Helen's house for Thanksgiving as of last night?","Let's calculate the number of cookies available for each day after accounting for the losses and the gift.

Day 1: Helen baked 31 cookies and Beaky ate 5.
31 - 5 = 26 cookies remaining from Day 1.

Day 2: Helen baked 270 cookies and 15% crumbled during the competition.
15% of 270 is (15/100) * 270 = 40.5, but since we can't have half a cookie, we'll round down to 40.
270 - 40 = 230 cookies remaining from Day 2.

Day 3: Helen baked 419 cookies and gave 30 away to her neighbors.
419 - 30 = 389 cookies remaining from Day 3.

Now, let's add the surprise gift from Lucy:
45 cookies gifted by Lucy.

Finally, we'll add up all the remaining cookies from each day and the gift:
26 (Day 1) + 230 (Day 2) + 389 (Day 3) + 45 (gift) = 690 cookies available at Helen's house for Thanksgiving as of last night.","Helen's cookie count:

Day 1: 31 cookies
Day 2: 270 cookies
Day 3: 419 cookies

Losses:
Beaky the bird ate 5 cookies
15% of 270 cookies crumbled: 0.15 x 270 = 40.5 cookies
30 cookies were given away

Gains: 45 cookies were gifted by Lucy

Total cookies available: 31 + 270 + 419 - 5 - 40.5 - 30 + 45 = 679.5

Therefore, the final count as of last night is **680 cookies**.","Let's calculate the number of cookies lost or given away each day:

Day 1:
- 5 cookies were eaten by Beaky.

Day 2:
- 15% of 270 cookies crumbled during the cookie stacking competition. To calculate this, we multiply 270 by 0.15:
  270 * 0.15 = 40.5
  40.5 is the number of cookies that crumbled.

Day 3:
- 30 cookies were given away to Helen's neighbors.

Now, let's add up the cookies lost or given away each day:

Day 1:
- 5 cookies

Day 2:
- 40.5 cookies

Day 3:
- 30 cookies

Total cookies lost or given away:
5 (Day 1) + 40.5 (Day 2) + 30 (Day 3) = 75.5

Now, let's subtract the cookies lost or given away from the total number of cookies baked each day:

Day 1:
31 cookies - 5 cookies = 26 cookies

Day 2:
270 cookies - 40.5 cookies = 229.5 cookies

Day 3:
419 cookies - 30 cookies = 389 cookies

Now, let's add up the remaining cookies from each day:

Day 1:
26 cookies

Day 2:
229.5 cookies

Day 3:
389 cookies

Total remaining cookies:
26 (Day 1) + 229.5 (Day 2) + 389 (Day 3) = 644.5

Finally, let's add the 45 cookies Helen received from Lucy to the total remaining cookies:

Room area = Length × Width
Room area = 8.3 feet × 12.7 feet
Room area = 105.41 square feet

Now, let's see how many large tiles (4 square feet each) we can fit into the room:

Number of large tiles = Room area ÷ Area of one large tile
Number of large tiles = 105.41 square feet ÷ 4 square feet/tile
Number of large tiles = 26.3525 tiles

Since we can't use a fraction of a tile, we'll use 26 large tiles, which will cover:

26 tiles × 4 square feet/tile = 104 square feet

Now, let's calculate the remaining area that needs to be covered with small tiles:

Remaining area = Room area - Area covered by large tiles
Remaining area = 105.41 square feet - 104 square feet
Remaining area = 1.41 square feet

Since each small tile covers 1 square foot, we'll need at least 2 small tiles to cover the remaining area (as we can't use a fraction of a tile).

So, the minimum number of each type of tile required to cover the entire floor without exceeding the floor area is:

- 26 large tiles (4 square feet each)
- 2 small tiles (1 square foot each)","To find the minimum number of tiles needed to cover Jesse's room, we need to divide the floor area between the two tile sizes.

Jesse's room is 8.3 x 12.7, which equals 105.41 square feet.

We want to minimize the total number of tiles, so we'll first divide the area by the largest tile size:

105.41 sq.ft / 4 sq.ft = 26.3525 tiles, or 26 tiles if we round down.

The remaining area is 105.41 sq.ft - 104 sq.ft = 1.41 sq.ft.

Now, we'll divide this remaining area by the smaller tile size:

1.41 sq.ft / 1 sq.ft = 1.41 tiles, or 2 tiles if we round up.

So, the minimum number of tiles needed is 26 + 2 = **28**.","First, we need to calculate the total area of Jesse's room. Since the room is 8.3 feet long and 12.7 feet wide, the area is:

Area = length × width
Area = 8.3 feet × 12.7 feet
Area = 104.01 square feet

Now, we need to find out how many large tiles (4 square feet each) and small tiles (1 square foot each) are needed to cover the entire floor without exceeding the floor area.

Let's start by dividing the total area by the area of one large tile:

Number of large tiles = Total area / Area of one large tile
Number of large tiles = 104.01 square feet / 4 square feet
Number of large tiles = 26.0025

Since we can't have a fraction of a tile, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jesse needs 26 large tiles to cover the floor.

Now, let's find out how many small tiles are needed:

Number of small tiles = Total area / Area of one small tile
Number of small tiles = 104.01 square feet / 1 square foot
Number of small tiles = 104.01

Again, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jesse needs 104 small tiles to cover the floor.

548,"For Gwen's birthday, she received some dollars and euros. She initially exchanged the euros into dollars at a rate of 1 euro = 1.2 dollars. Then, she spent 8 dollars on a gift, 10% of the remaining dollars on a meal, and further exchanged 5 euros back into dollars to lend a friend. After these transactions, Gwen had 1 euro and 6 dollars left with her. How much money, in dollars and euros, did Gwen initially receive for her birthday?","Let's denote the initial amount of dollars Gwen received as D and the initial amount of euros as E.

When Gwen exchanged her euros into dollars, she received 1.2 dollars for each euro. So, the total amount in dollars after the exchange was D + 1.2E.

Then, she spent 8 dollars on a gift, so she had D + 1.2E - 8 dollars left.

Next, she spent 10% of the remaining dollars on a meal. The amount spent on the meal is 0.10 * (D + 1.2E - 8). After the meal, she had the following amount left:
D + 1.2E - 8 - 0.10 * (D + 1.2E - 8) = 0.90 * (D + 1.2E - 8)

Then, she exchanged 5 euros back into dollars for her friend at the same rate of 1 euro = 1.2 dollars, which is an additional 5 * 1.2 = 6 dollars.

After all these transactions, Gwen had 1 euro and 6 dollars left. So, we can set up the following equation:
0.90 * (D + 1.2E - 8) + 6 = 6

Now, let's solve for D + 1.2E:
0.90 * (D + 1.2E - 8) = 0
D + 1.2E - 8 = 0 / 0.90
D + 1.2E - 8 = 0

Now, we know that Gwen had 1 euro left, which means she initially had E + 1 euros before she lent 5 euros to her friend. So, we can write another equation:
E + 1 - 5 = 1
E - 4 = 1
E = 5

Now that we know Gwen initially had 5 euros, we can substitute E with 5 in the equation D + 1.2E - 8 = 0 to find the initial amount of dollars (D):
D + 1.2(5) - 8 = 0
D + 6 - 8 = 0
D - 2 = 0
D = 2

So, Gwen initially received 2 dollars and 5 euros for her birthday.","Gwen initially received 13 dollars and 8 euros for her birthday.

&\text{Euros initially} = 8\ \text{euros}
\end{aligned}
$$","Let's denote the number of euros Gwen initially received as E and the number of dollars as D.

According to the information given, Gwen initially exchanged E euros into dollars at a rate of 1 euro = 1.2 dollars. This means that for every euro, she got 1.2 dollars. So, the total number of dollars she got from exchanging euros is 1.2E.

After exchanging the euros, Gwen had D + 1.2E dollars.

Then, she spent 8 dollars on a gift, so the remaining dollars became D + 1.2E - 8.

Next, she spent 10% of the remaining dollars on a meal. Since 10% of a number is the same as multiplying the number by 0.1, the amount she spent on the meal is 0.1(D + 1.2E - 8).

After spending on the meal, the remaining dollars became D + 1.2E - 8 - 0.1(D + 1.2E - 8).

Gwen then exchanged 5 euros back into dollars to lend a friend. Since 1 euro = 1.2 dollars, the amount she got from exchanging 5 euros is 5 * 1.2 = 6 dollars.

After these transactions, Gwen had 1 euro and 6 dollars left with her. So, the remaining dollars after the meal and the exchange for her friend are D + 1.2E - 8 - 0.1(D + 1.2E - 8) + 6.

We know that the remaining dollars and euros are 1 and 6, respectively, so we can set up the equation:

D + 1.2E - 8 - 0.1(D + 1.2E - 8) + 6 = 1
D + 1.2E - 8 - 0.1D - 0.12E + 8 + 6 = 1
D + 1.2E - 8 - 0.1D - 0.12E + 14 = 1
D + 1.2E - 8 - 0.1D - 0.12E + 14 = 1
D + 1.2E - 8 - 0.1D - 0.12E + 14 = 1
D + 1.2E - 8 - 0.1D - 0.12E = 1 - 14

549,"At the zoo, a cage had 3 snakes, 75 alligators, 54 monkeys, and 45 turtles. If hiding animals were 82 snakes, 19 alligators, 32 monkeys, and 20 turtles, find out how many alligators and monkeys were not hiding. Additionally, if the total weight of all the animals in the cage is 22800 pounds, and the ratio of the weight of visible/snakes:visible/alligators:visible/monkeys:visible/turtles is 2:8:5:3, find the combined weight of the snakes and turtles in the cage.","First, let's find out how many alligators and monkeys were not hiding.

Visible alligators = Total alligators - Hiding alligators
Visible alligators = 75 - 19
Visible alligators = 56

Visible monkeys = Total monkeys - Hiding monkeys
Visible monkeys = 54 - 32
Visible monkeys = 22

So, there were 56 alligators and 22 monkeys not hiding.

Now, let's find the combined weight of the snakes and turtles in the cage.

The ratio of the weight of visible animals is given as snakes:alligators:monkeys:turtles = 2:8:5:3. This means for every 2 parts of weight of snakes, there are 8 parts of alligators, 5 parts of monkeys, and 3 parts of turtles.

Let's find the total parts represented by the ratio:
Total parts = 2 (snakes) + 8 (alligators) + 5 (monkeys) + 3 (turtles)
Total parts = 2 + 8 + 5 + 3
Total parts = 18

Now, we know the total weight of all the animals in the cage is 22800 pounds. We need to find out how much weight is represented by each part.

Weight per part = Total weight / Total parts
Weight per part = 22800 / 18
Weight per part = 1266.67 pounds (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, we can find the combined weight of the snakes and turtles.

Weight of snakes = 2 parts * Weight per part
Weight of snakes = 2 * 1266.67
Weight of snakes = 2533.34 pounds

Weight of turtles = 3 parts * Weight per part
Weight of turtles = 3 * 1266.67
Weight of turtles = 3800.01 pounds

Combined weight of snakes and turtles = Weight of snakes + Weight of turtles
Combined weight of snakes and turtles = 2533.34 + 3800.01
Combined weight of snakes and turtles = 6333.35 pounds

So, the combined weight of the snakes and turtles in the cage is approximately 6333.35 pounds.","Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many alligators and monkeys were not hiding. We're given the numbers for animals hiding, so we subtract these from the total:

Not hiding: 75 - 19 = 56 alligators
Not hiding: 54 - 32 = 22 monkeys

Now, we're told the weight ratio of the visible animals, and we're also given the total weight of all the animals. We can use this information to find the weight of the visible animals, and from there, we can calculate the weight of the snakes and turtles.

2 parts snakes + 8 parts visible alligators + 5 parts visible monkeys + 3 parts visible turtles = 22800

We know the combined weight of the visible alligators, monkeys, and turtles is 8 x some number, and the snakes' weight is 2 x that same number. So, we can find this unknown number first:

8x + 2x = 22800
x = 2100

The weight of the visible animals is 8 x 2100 = 16800 pounds. 

Now we can find the combined weight of the snakes and turtles:

2x + 3x = 5400 pounds

The snakes and turtles together weigh 8400.

Therefore, the final result is 8400.","First, let's find out how many alligators and monkeys were not hiding:

Number of alligators not hiding = Total number of alligators - Number of alligators hiding
Number of alligators not hiding = 75 - 19
Number of alligators not hiding = 56

Number of monkeys not hiding = Total number of monkeys - Number of monkeys hiding
Number of monkeys not hiding = 54 - 32
Number of monkeys not hiding = 22

Next, let's find the combined weight of the snakes and turtles in the cage using the given ratio:

The ratio of the weight of visible/snakes:visible/alligators:visible/monkeys:visible/turtles is 2:8:5:3.

Let's denote the weight of the visible snakes as S, the weight of the visible alligators as A, the weight of the visible monkeys as M, and the weight of the visible turtles as T.

According to the ratio, we have:

S : A : M : T = 2 : 8 : 5 : 3

We know that the total weight of all the animals in the cage is 22800 pounds. Let's denote the total weight of the visible animals as V.

V = S + A + M + T

Since the ratio gives us the proportion of the weights of the visible animals, we can set up the following equation:

S / A = 2 / 8
S / M = 2 / 5
S / T = 2 / 3

Now, let's solve for S:

S / A = 2 / 8
S = (2 / 8) * A
S = 0.25 * A

S / M = 2 / 5
S = (2 / 5) * M
S = 0.4 * M

S / T = 2 / 3
S = (2 / 3) * T
S = 0.67 * T

Now, let's find the value of S using any of the equations:

S = 0.25 * A
S = 0.4 * M
S = 0.67 * T

Since we don't have the individual weights of the visible animals, we can't solve for S directly. However, we can express S in terms of V:

S = (2 / 8) * V
S = 0.25 * V

Now, let's find the value of V using the total weight of all the animals:

V = S + A + M + T
V = 0.25 * V + A",8400,56,6333.35

According to the information given, each basket contains:
- 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, making a total of \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) peaches per basket.
- 2 yellow apples per basket.
- 5 oranges per basket.

We are also given the total number of each fruit:
- There are 28 peaches in total.
- There are 14 apples in total.
- There are 35 oranges in total.

To find the number of baskets, we can use any of the fruit totals and divide by the number of that fruit per basket.

Using peaches:
\( 7B = 28 \)
\( B = 28 / 7 \)
\( B = 4 \)

Using apples:
\( 2B = 14 \)
\( B = 14 / 2 \)
\( B = 7 \)

Using oranges:
\( 5B = 35 \)
\( B = 35 / 5 \)
\( B = 7 \)

There seems to be a discrepancy in the number of baskets when using peaches compared to apples and oranges. Let's recheck the calculations.

For peaches:
\( 7B = 28 \)
\( B = 28 / 7 \)
\( B = 4 \) (This is correct.)

For apples:
\( 2B = 14 \)
\( B = 14 / 2 \)
\( B = 7 \) (This is incorrect because each basket has 2 apples, so the number of baskets should be 14 divided by 2, which is 7.)

For oranges:
\( 5B = 35 \)
\( B = 35 / 5 \)
\( B = 7 \) (This is correct.)

The correct number of baskets is determined by the peaches and oranges, which both indicate there are 7 baskets. The calculation for apples was correct, but the conclusion was mistakenly stated as incorrect. Therefore, there are 7 baskets of fruits.","There are **six** baskets of fruits.

This is calculated by dividing the number of fruits by the number of fruits per basket:

28 peaches ÷ 4 peaches per basket = 7
14 apples ÷ 2 apples per basket = 7
35 oranges ÷ 5 oranges per basket = 7

As 7 = 7 × 1 basket, there must be 7 baskets in total.","Let's denote the number of baskets as B.

From the information given, we know that each basket contains 4 red peaches, 3 green peaches, 2 yellow apples, and 5 oranges.

The total number of peaches is given as 28, so we can write the equation:

4B (for red peaches) + 3B (for green peaches) = 28

Now, let's solve for B:

7B = 28
B = 28 / 7
B = 4

552,"Jerry had 7 action figures on a shelf in his room, which were arranged in an arithmetic sequence. Later, he added some more action figures to the shelf and removed 10 of the old ones. After that, the remaining action figures were still in an arithmetic sequence. If there are 8 action figures on his shelf now, and the first and last action figures on the shelf before and after the change were not removed, how many action figures did he add to the shelf, considering that the common difference in the arithmetic sequences remained the same?","Let's denote the common difference of the arithmetic sequence as \( d \). Since the first and last action figures were not removed, the common difference remains the same before and after the change.

Before the change, Jerry had 7 action figures. Let's denote the value of the first action figure as \( a \), so the values of the action figures on the shelf can be represented as:
\[ a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, a+5d, a+6d \]

After the change, Jerry has 8 action figures on the shelf, and they are still in an arithmetic sequence with the same common difference \( d \). The first and last action figures are the same, so the sequence is:
\[ a, a+d, ..., a+7d \]

Since Jerry removed 10 action figures and now has 8, he must have added \( 8 + 10 = 18 \) action figures to the shelf to have 8 remaining after removing 10.

Therefore, Jerry added 18 action figures to the shelf.","Jerry initially had 7 action figures on his shelf, and after changes, he has 8. We know that the first and last action figures remained on the shelf through the changes. Therefore we can assume that the first and last action figures were not part of the ones removed, and the number of remaining action figures is the same as the number of removed action figures.

If we denote the number of added action figures as x, the initial sequence had 7 + 10 - 8 = 9 action figures left after the removal, and the new sequence is obtained by adding x to this number, resulting in a total of 9 + x action figures.

Since the new sequence is also arranged in an arithmetic sequence, the common difference remained the same. The first and last action figure in the new sequence are the same as before, implying that the new sequence starts where the old one ended. Therefore the 8th action figure in the new sequence is obtained by adding the same difference seven times to the last action figure of the old sequence.

We can now calculate the difference. The difference is given by $\frac{8\text{th AF} - \text{Last AF of old seq.}}{7}$.
Solving this results in a difference of 1. 

Knowing that the sequence has a difference of 1 and starts at the last action figure of the old sequence, we can easily count that x, the number of added action figures, is equal to 4.

The result is 4.","Let's denote the common difference in the arithmetic sequence as \( d \).

Before Jerry made any changes, he had 7 action figures on the shelf, which were arranged in an arithmetic sequence. The first term of this sequence is 1 (since it's an arithmetic sequence, the first term is always 1), and the common difference is \( d \). So, the sequence before the changes was:

1, 1 + \( d \), 1 + \( 2d \), 1 + \( 3d \), 1 + \( 4d \), 1 + \( 5d \), 1 + \( 6d \)

After Jerry removed 10 of the old ones, he was left with 7 - 10 = 3 action figures. These 3 action figures were still in an arithmetic sequence, so the sequence after the removal was:

1, 1 + \( d \), 1 + \( 2d \)

Jerry then added some more action figures to the shelf, so that there are now 8 action figures on the shelf. Since the first and last action figures on the shelf before and after the change were not removed, we know that the first and last action figures in the new sequence are the same as before the changes. Therefore, the new sequence starts with 1 and ends with 1 + \( 6d \).

The new sequence is:

1, 1 + \( d \), 1 + \( 2d \), 1 + \( 3d \), 1 + \( 4d \), 1 + \( 5d \), 1 + \( 6d \)

We know that the last term in the new sequence is 1 + \( 6d \), so the number of terms in the new sequence is 8 (since there are 8 action figures on the shelf now).

To find out how many action figures Jerry added, we need to count the terms in the new sequence that were not in the old sequence.

The old sequence had 7 terms, and the new sequence has 8 terms. The first and last terms are the same in both sequences, so we need to count the terms from the second to the seventh in the new sequence that were not in the old sequence.

The terms from the second to the seventh in the new sequence are:

1 + \( d \), 1 + \( 2d \), 1 + \( 3d \), 1 + \( 4d \), 1 + \( 5d \)

These terms were not in the old sequence, so Jerry added 5 terms to the shelf.

Therefore, Jerry added 5 action figures to the shelf.",4,5,18
553,"Danny and his friend Emma went to the park to search for bottle caps to add to their collections. Danny had 25 bottle caps in his collection before going to the park, and Emma had 18 bottle caps in hers. At the park, they found a total of 40 bottle caps, and they decided to divide them according to the ratio of their initial collections. After they divided the bottle caps, Danny gave 5 of his found bottle caps to his brother as a gift. How many bottle caps did Danny and Emma each end up with?","To divide the 40 bottle caps according to the ratio of their initial collections, we first need to determine the ratio of Danny's collection to Emma's collection.

Danny had 25 bottle caps, and Emma had 18 bottle caps. The ratio of Danny's collection to Emma's collection is therefore 25:18.

To divide the 40 bottle caps according to this ratio, we need to find out how many parts of the ratio the total number of bottle caps (40) corresponds to.

The sum of the parts of the ratio is 25 + 18 = 43 parts.

Now, we need to find out how many bottle caps correspond to one part of the ratio. We do this by dividing the total number of bottle caps found (40) by the total number of parts (43).

40 bottle caps ÷ 43 parts = approximately 0.9302 bottle caps per part

Now we can calculate how many bottle caps Danny and Emma each get:

- Danny gets 25 parts, so he gets 25 * 0.9302 ≈ 23.255 bottle caps.
- Emma gets 18 parts, so she gets 18 * 0.9302 ≈ 16.7436 bottle caps.

Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle cap, we'll round to the nearest whole number. However, we must ensure that the total number of bottle caps remains 40.

If we round Danny's share down to 23 bottle caps and Emma's share down to 16 bottle caps, the total would be 23 + 16 = 39 bottle caps, which is one less than the 40 they found.

If we round Danny's share up to 24 bottle caps and Emma's share down to 16 bottle caps, the total would be 24 + 16 = 40 bottle caps, which is correct.

So, Danny initially gets 24 bottle caps, and Emma gets 16 bottle caps.

However, Danny then gives 5 of his bottle caps to his brother, so we subtract 5 from Danny's total:

Danny's final count: 24 - 5 = 19 bottle caps
Emma's final count remains the same at 16 bottle caps.

Therefore, Danny ends up with 19 bottle caps, and Emma ends up with 16 bottle caps.","Danny had 25 bottle caps and Emma had 18 before going to the park, so the total ratio they had is 25:18. They found 40 new bottle caps, which we can divide by the total ratio of their initial collections: (25 + 18) 40 = 43:40. 

After dividing the found bottle caps and before giving any away, Danny would have 43/8 x 40 = 53.75 bottle caps, and Emma would have the remaining 28.25 bottle caps. 

Danny then gave 5 bottle caps to his brother, so in the end, Danny has 53.75 - 5 = 48.75 bottle caps, and Emma has 28.25 bottle caps. 

The final result is 49.","Danny and Emma decided to divide the bottle caps they found at the park according to the ratio of their initial collections. Before going to the park, Danny had 25 bottle caps and Emma had 18 bottle caps. To find the ratio of their initial collections, we divide the number of bottle caps each of them had by the total number of bottle caps they had combined:

Danny's ratio = 25 / (25 + 18) = 25 / 43
Emma's ratio = 18 / (25 + 18) = 18 / 43

Now, let's find the ratio of their initial collections to the total number of bottle caps they found at the park:

Danny's ratio = 25 / 43 * 40 = 25 * 40 / 43 * 40 = 1000 / 43 * 40 = 23.023255813953488 * 40 = 920.9301361445315
Emma's ratio = 18 / 43 * 40 = 18 * 40 / 43 * 40 = 720 / 43 * 40 = 16.666666666666668 * 40 = 666.6666666666667

Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle cap, we'll round the number of bottle caps each of them ends up with to the nearest whole number.

Danny ends up with approximately 920.9301361445315 bottle caps, which we'll round to 921 bottle caps.
Emma ends up with approximately 666.6666666666667 bottle caps, which we'll round to 667 bottle caps.

After Danny gives 5 of his found bottle caps to his brother, he will have 921 - 5 = 916 bottle caps.

So, Danny ends up with 916 bottle caps, and Emma ends up with 667 bottle caps.",49,916921,16
554,"Paige raised 7 goldfish, 12 catfish, 8 guppies, and 5 angelfish in the pond. However, stray cats loved eating them, and a few fell victim to natural predators like birds and larger fish. Additionally, a disease spread among the fish population, causing several of them to die. Now, Paige has 27 fish left in the pond. How many fish disappeared due to these combined factors, and can you determine how many of each type of fish remain?","Paige originally had a total number of fish calculated as follows:

7 goldfish + 12 catfish + 8 guppies + 5 angelfish = 32 fish

Now, she has 27 fish left. To find out how many fish disappeared, we subtract the current number of fish from the original number:

32 fish (original) - 27 fish (current) = 5 fish disappeared

Without specific information on how many of each type of fish disappeared, we cannot determine the exact number of each type of fish remaining. We only know that a total of 5 fish are gone, but the distribution of that loss among the different types of fish is unknown.","Paige initially had 7 + 12 + 8 + 5 = 32 fish.

Due to the stray cats, predators, and disease, 32 - 27 = 5 fish disappeared.

It's not possible to determine how many of each type of fish remain, as this would require more specific information. However, we do know that of the 27 remaining fish, they must include at least 5 goldfish, 5 catfish, and 5 angelfish, based on the initial count of these three types.

**22**","Let's calculate the total number of fish Paige originally had and then subtract the number of fish left to find out how many disappeared.

Originally, Paige had:
- 7 goldfish
- 12 catfish
- 8 guppies
- 5 angelfish

Total number of fish originally = 7 + 12 + 8 + 5 = 32

Now, Paige has 27 fish left. To find out how many fish disappeared, we subtract the number of fish left from the original number of fish:

Fish disappeared = Original number of fish - Number of fish left
Fish disappeared = 32 - 27 = 5

So, 5 fish disappeared due to the combined factors of stray cats, natural predators, and disease.

To determine how many of each type of fish remain, we subtract the number of each type of fish that disappeared from the original number of each type:

- Remaining goldfish = Original number of goldfish - Number of goldfish disappeared
- Remaining catfish = Original number of catfish - Number of catfish disappeared
- Remaining guppies = Original number of guppies - Number of guppies disappeared
- Remaining angelfish = Original number of angelfish - Number of angelfish disappeared

- Remaining goldfish = 7 - 0 = 7
- Remaining catfish = 12 - 0 = 12
- Remaining guppies = 8 - 0 = 8
- Remaining angelfish = 5 - 0 = 5

So, Paige has 7 goldfish, 12 catfish, 8 guppies, and 5 angelfish remaining.",22,Five.,5
555,"A grocery store had 67 bottles of regular cola, 45 bottles of regular lemon soda, and 23 bottles of regular orange soda. There were 9 bottles of diet cola, 32 bottles of diet lemon soda, and 12 bottles of diet orange soda. Each bottle of regular soda had a 20% discount, while each bottle of diet soda had a 30% discount. If customers bought all the regular and diet sodas, how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda were sold at the store after considering the discount rates?","First, let's find out the total number of regular soda bottles sold:

Regular cola: 67 bottles
Regular lemon soda: 45 bottles
Regular orange soda: 23 bottles

Total regular soda bottles = 67 + 45 + 23 = 135 bottles

Now, let's find out the total number of diet soda bottles sold:

Diet cola: 9 bottles
Diet lemon soda: 32 bottles
Diet orange soda: 12 bottles

Total diet soda bottles = 9 + 32 + 12 = 53 bottles

To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda were sold, we subtract the total number of diet soda bottles from the total number of regular soda bottles:

More regular soda bottles sold = Total regular soda bottles - Total diet soda bottles
More regular soda bottles sold = 135 - 53 = 82 bottles

So, 82 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda were sold at the store. The discount rates do not affect the count of the bottles sold.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the total number of regular and diet sodas sold:
   - Regular cola: 67 bottles
   - Regular lemon soda: 45 bottles
   - Regular orange soda: 23 bottles
   - Total regular sodas: 67 + 45 + 23 = 135 bottles

   - Diet cola: 9 bottles
   - Diet lemon soda: 32 bottles
   - Diet orange soda: 12 bottles
   - Total diet sodas: 9 + 32 + 12 = 53 bottles

2. Compute the discount for each type of soda:
   - Regular soda discount: 20%
   - Diet soda discount: 30%

3. Find the discounted price for regular and diet sodas:
   - Discounted regular soda price = 135 bottles * 20% = 27 bottles
   - Discounted diet soda price = 53 bottles * 30% = 15.9 bottles

4. Calculate the difference in the number of bottles:
   - 135 bottles of regular soda - 53 bottles of diet soda = 82 bottles

Therefore, the grocery store sold **82 bottles** more of regular soda than diet soda after applying the discount rates.","First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of regular soda and diet soda sold:

Regular soda:
- Cola: 67 bottles
- Lemon soda: 45 bottles
- Orange soda: 23 bottles
Total regular soda bottles = 67 + 45 + 23 = 135 bottles

Diet soda:
- Cola: 9 bottles
- Lemon soda: 32 bottles
- Orange soda: 12 bottles
Total diet soda bottles = 9 + 32 + 12 = 53 bottles

Now, let's calculate the total discount for each type of soda:

Regular soda discount:
- Cola: 67 bottles * 20% = 67 * 0.20 = 13.40
- Lemon soda: 45 bottles * 20% = 45 * 0.20 = 9.00
- Orange soda: 23 bottles * 20% = 23 * 0.20 = 4.60
Total regular soda discount = 13.40 + 9.00 + 4.60 = 27.00

Diet soda discount:
- Cola: 9 bottles * 30% = 9 * 0.30 = 2.70
- Lemon soda: 32 bottles * 30% = 32 * 0.30 = 9.60
- Orange soda: 12 bottles * 30% = 12 * 0.30 = 3.60
Total diet soda discount = 2.70 + 9.60 + 3.60 = 15.90

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of soda after the discount:

Regular soda cost:
- Cola: 67 bottles * 100% = 67 * 1.00 = 67
- Lemon soda: 45 bottles * 100% = 45 * 1.00 = 45
- Orange soda: 23 bottles * 100% = 23 * 1.00 = 23
Total regular soda cost = 67 + 45 + 23 = 135

Diet soda cost:
- Cola: 9 bottles * 100% = 9 * 1.00 = 9
- Lemon soda: 32 bottles * 100% = 32 * 1.00 = 32
- Orange soda: 12 bottles * 100% = 1",82,135,82
556,"Let x be the number of days Jessie jogged. Each day, she lost y kilograms while jogging. Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms. After starting to jog, she lost a total weight of 101 kilograms. How much did she weigh before starting to jog, and find the daily weight loss amount, y, if she jogged for x days?","Let's denote Jessie's initial weight before starting to jog as W. After jogging for x days, she lost a total of 101 kilograms, so we can write the following equation:

W - 101 = 27

Now, we can solve for W to find out how much Jessie weighed before she started jogging:

W = 27 + 101
W = 128 kilograms

So, Jessie weighed 128 kilograms before she started jogging.

Now, let's find the daily weight loss amount, y. Since Jessie lost 101 kilograms over x days, we can write the following equation:

y * x = 101

To find the value of y, we need to know the number of days x that Jessie jogged. Without the value of x, we cannot determine the exact daily weight loss amount, y. If you provide the number of days x, we can calculate y.","We're asked to find the weight Jessie had before jogging and the daily weight loss, keeping in mind that these are unknowns. We also know some other details:

- Let x represent the number of days Jessie jogged.
- Each day, she lost an unknown amount of weight, y.
- She currently weighs 27 kg.
- After jogging for these x days, she has lost a total of 101 kg.

We can represent this mathematically as follows:
x * y = 101 kg

We also know the final weight is:
27 kg + y kg = 34 kg (this is 101 kg minus the 77 kg she lost while jogging)

Now, we can solve for x and y:
- x = 101 kg / y
- y = 34 kg - 27 kg = 7 kg

So, Jessie's initial weight was 34 kilograms, and she lost 7 kilograms each day she jogged.

**34**","Let's denote the weight Jessie lost each day as y kilograms. We know that after x days of jogging, she lost a total of 101 kilograms.

The total weight loss can be calculated as:
Total weight loss = y * x

We also know that after jogging, Jessie weighs 27 kilograms. So, the total weight loss is the difference between her original weight and her current weight:
Total weight loss = Original weight - Current weight

We can set up the equation:
y * x = 101
27 = Original weight - 101

Now, let's solve for the original weight:
Original weight = 27 + 101
Original weight = 128 kilograms

Now we have the original weight, we can find the daily weight loss amount, y:
y = Total weight loss / x
y = 101 / x

So, Jessie weighed 128 kilograms before starting to jog, and the daily weight loss amount, y, is 101 / x kilograms.",34,101/x,128

177 tomatoes - 53 tomatoes = 124 tomatoes left

12 potatoes - 15 potatoes = 7 potatoes left

25 cabbages + 32 cabbages = 57 cabbages

10 eggplants + 18 eggplants = 28 eggplants

4 more sparrows joined, so now there are 3 + 4 = 7 sparrows.

Twice the number of pigeons joined, so 2 * 2 = 4 pigeons joined. Now there are 2 + 4 = 6 pigeons.

The number of storks doubled, so now there are 5 * 2 = 10 storks.

To find out how many more sparrows than storks are sitting on the fence now, we subtract the number of storks from the number of sparrows:

How much total money did the ring toss game make during the 22 days?","Let's calculate the daily revenue for the days with higher income and the days with lower income.

For the days with higher income (10% more than the average):
Higher income per day = Average income per day + (10% of Average income per day)
Higher income per day = $144 + (0.10 * $144)
Higher income per day = $144 + $14.40
Higher income per day = $158.40

For the days with lower income (20% less than the average):
Lower income per day = Average income per day - (20% of Average income per day)
Lower income per day = $144 - (0.20 * $144)
Lower income per day = $144 - $28.80
Lower income per day = $115.20

Now, let's calculate the total revenue for the 22 days:

Total revenue from higher income days = Higher income per day * Number of higher income days
Total revenue from higher income days = $158.40 * 12
Total revenue from higher income days = $1900.80

Total revenue from lower income days = Lower income per day * Number of lower income days
Total revenue from lower income days = $115.20 * 10
Total revenue from lower income days = $1152.00

Total revenue for the 22 days = Total revenue from higher income days + Total revenue from lower income days
Total revenue for the 22 days = $1900.80 + $1152.00
Total revenue for the 22 days = $3052.80

Therefore, the ring toss game made a total of $3052.80 during the 22 days at the carnival.","The average daily revenue is $144, and on some days, the income is 10% higher, so $144 * 110/100 = $158.40. 
On the other hand, the lower income days make 20% less, so $144 * 80/100 = $115.20. 

We have 12 higher income days and 10 lower income days. 
The total revenue would be $158.40 * 12 + $115.20 * 10 = $136.80 * 12 + $115.20 * 10 = $1641.60.

So, the higher income days have a revenue of R + 0.10R = 1.10R, and the lower income days have a revenue of R - 0.20R = 0.80R.

We are told that there were 12 days with higher income and 10 days with lower income. The total revenue for the 22 days can be calculated as follows:

Total revenue = (12 days * 1.10R) + (10 days * 0.80R)

Later, Baker A sold 15 cakes and 103 pastries while Baker B sold 5 cakes and 130 pastries. How many pastries would Baker A still have?","First, let's find out how many cakes and pastries each baker would have after redistribution.

Baker A initially made 7 cakes and Baker B made 10 cakes. Together, they made 7 + 10 = 17 cakes. Since they want to have an equal number of cakes, each baker would have 17 / 2 = 8.5 cakes. However, since they can't have half a cake, let's assume they split the last cake and each baker ends up with 8 cakes and a half cake each.

For the pastries, Baker A made 148 pastries and Baker B made 200 pastries. Together, they made 148 + 200 = 348 pastries. They want to have an equal number of pastries, so each baker would have 348 / 2 = 174 pastries.

After redistribution, Baker A would have 8 cakes and 174 pastries, and Baker B would have 8 cakes and 174 pastries.

Baker A then sold 15 cakes and 103 pastries. Since Baker A had 8 cakes, they can't sell 15 cakes, so there might be a mistake in the information provided. However, we can still calculate the pastries.

Baker A had 174 pastries and sold 103, so Baker A would have 174 - 103 = 71 pastries left.","To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of cakes and pastries each baker has after redistribution. By adding the number of cakes and pastries for both bakers, we find that Baker A has 22 cakes and 245 pastries, while Baker B has 25 cakes and 255 pastries. 

After the sales, Baker A has 245 - 103 = 142 pastries remaining.

The final result is: 142.","First, let's find out how many cakes and pastries each baker has after redistributing them.

Since they want to have equal numbers of cakes and pastries, we can set up the following equations:

For Baker A:
7 cakes + x pastries = 10 cakes + y pastries

For Baker B:
10 cakes + y pastries = 7 cakes + x pastries

Now, let's solve for x and y:

From the first equation, we can express y in terms of x:
y = 10 cakes + x pastries - 7 cakes
y = 3 cakes + x pastries

Now, let's substitute this expression for y into the second equation:
10 cakes + (3 cakes + x pastries) = 7 cakes + x pastries
13 cakes + x pastries = 7 cakes + x pastries

13 cakes - 7 cakes = x pastries
6 cakes = x pastries

If Juan returned 60% of the sweet cookies, he gave back 1.8 which Paco ate, leaving him with the same amount of sweet cookies. 

In total, Paco had 12 salty cookies and 3 sweet cookies left. 

**12**","Paco started with 26 salty cookies and 17 sweet cookies.

He shared 11 salty cookies and 9 sweet cookies with Ana, so he had 26 - 11 = 15 salty cookies left.

He then shared 3 salty cookies and 5 sweet cookies with Juan, so he had 15 - 3 = 12 salty cookies left.

Ana and Juan returned 60% of the sweet cookies they got, which is 60% of 9 for Ana and 60% of 5 for Juan.

For Ana: 60% of 9 = 0.60 * 9 = 5.4, so she returned 5.4 sweet cookies.
For Juan: 60% of 5 = 0.60 * 5 = 3, so he returned 3 sweet cookies.

Paco ate the returned sweet cookies, so he ate 5.4 + 3 = 8.4 sweet cookies.

To find out how many salty cookies Paco had left, we subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the total number of salty cookies he had left:

12 (salty cookies left) - 8.4 (sweet cookies eaten) = 3.6 (salty cookies left).

Since Paco can't have a fraction of a cookie, we round to the nearest whole number. Paco had approximately 3.6 salty cookies left, which we can round to 4 salty cookies left.",12,4,12
575,"Marco and his dad, along with his sister, went fruit picking. Together they collected 30 pounds of strawberries, 20 pounds of blueberries, and 12 pounds of raspberries. On the way back Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries, 2 pounds of blueberries and his sister lost 5 pounds of raspberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds and his blueberries weighed 8 pounds. How much did his dad's and sister's remaining strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries weigh now?","Let's start by calculating the total weight of each type of fruit after the losses:

Strawberries: 30 pounds - 8 pounds lost = 22 pounds remaining
Blueberries: 20 pounds - 2 pounds lost = 18 pounds remaining
Raspberries: 12 pounds - 5 pounds lost = 7 pounds remaining

Now we know that Marco has 12 pounds of strawberries and 8 pounds of blueberries. We don't know how many raspberries Marco has, but we can assume he didn't lose any since the text doesn't mention it.

To find out how much fruit Marco's dad and sister have left, we subtract Marco's share from the remaining total:

Dad's and sister's strawberries: 22 pounds remaining - Marco's 12 pounds = 10 pounds
Dad's and sister's blueberries: 18 pounds remaining - Marco's 8 pounds = 10 pounds
Dad's and sister's raspberries: 7 pounds remaining (since we don't know Marco's share, we assume he didn't lose any, so this is the total for dad and sister)

In conclusion, Marco's dad and sister have 10 pounds of strawberries, 10 pounds of blueberries, and 7 pounds of raspberries remaining.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Marco's initial strawberries: 30 lb - 8 lb = 22 pounds.

2. Marco's initial blueberries: 20 lb - 2 lb = 18 pounds.

3. His sister's initial raspberries: 12 lb - 5 lb = 7 pounds.

4. Now, we add Marco's dad's remaining fruits to the sister's. Marco's dad has 14 pounds of strawberries left (30 - 8) and 18 pounds of blueberries (20 - 2).
So, the total weight of Marco's dad and sister's remaining fruits is:

4a. Strawberries: 14 pounds + 22 pounds = 36 pounds.

4b. Blueberries: 18 pounds + 18 pounds = 36 pounds.

4c. Raspberries: 7 pounds + Marco's 0 pounds = 7 pounds.

5. The total weight of all the remaining fruit is 36 + 36 + 7 = 79 pounds.

Therefore, the final answer is 79.

**79**","First, let's find out how much Marco's dad and sister lost in total:

Dad's losses:
- 8 pounds of strawberries
- 2 pounds of blueberries

Sister's losses:
- 5 pounds of raspberries

Total losses:
Dad's losses + Sister's losses = 8 + 2 + 5 = 15 pounds

Now, let's find out how much Marco's dad and sister have left:

Dad's remaining strawberries:
30 pounds (total) - 8 pounds (lost) = 22 pounds

Dad's remaining blueberries:
20 pounds (total) - 2 pounds (lost) = 18 pounds

Sister's remaining raspberries:
12 pounds (total) - 5 pounds (lost) = 7 pounds

So, Marco's dad's and sister's remaining strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries weigh:

Dad's remaining strawberries: 22 pounds
Dad's remaining blueberries: 18 pounds
Sister's remaining raspberries: 7 pounds

Total weight of their remaining fruit: 22 pounds (dad's strawberries) + 18 pounds (dad's blueberries) + 7 pounds (sister's raspberries) = 47 pounds.",Seventy-nine,47,7.
576,"Let x be the initial number of apples on Rachel's tree. She picks y apples from her tree. After a week, z new apples grow on the tree. However, a decay factor d affects the number of apples over time, causing a certain number of apples to fall from the tree.

Given that x = 4, y = 2, z = 3, and d = 0.25 (25% of apples fall from the tree each week), calculate the number of apples remaining on the tree after one week.","Initially, Rachel has x apples on her tree. After picking y apples, the number of apples remaining on the tree is:

Remaining apples = x - y

Substituting the given values:

Remaining apples = 4 - 2
Remaining apples = 2

After a week, z new apples grow on the tree, so the new total number of apples on the tree is:

New total apples = Remaining apples + z
New total apples = 2 + 3
New total apples = 5

However, due to the decay factor d, 25% of the apples fall from the tree. To find out how many apples fall, we calculate:

Apples that fall = d * New total apples
Apples that fall = 0.25 * 5
Apples that fall = 1.25

Since we cannot have a fraction of an apple fall from the tree, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 apple falling from the tree.

Finally, the number of apples remaining on the tree after one week, accounting for the decay factor, is:

Final number of apples = New total apples - Apples that fall
Final number of apples = 5 - 1
Final number of apples = 4

So, there are 4 apples remaining on the tree after one week.","We are asked to find the number of apples that will remain on the tree after one week, given the initial number of apples $x$, the number picked $y$, the new apples grown $z$, and the decay factor $d$.

Let's calculate this step by step. We have:
$x = 4$,
$y = 2$,
$z = 3$, and
$d = 0.25$.

To find the number of apples after one week, we first pick the apples:
$x - y = 4 - 2 = 2$.

Next, we add the newly grown apples:
$2 + z = 2 + 3 = 5$.

Now, we apply the decay factor. Since 25% of the apples fall each week, we multiply the current number of apples by $1 - d$:
$5 * (1 - 0.25) = 5 * 0.75 = 3.75$.

So, after one week, **3.75** apples remain on the tree.","To calculate the number of apples remaining on the tree after one week, we need to consider the initial number of apples (x), the apples picked (y), the new apples that grow (z), and the decay factor (d).

First, let's calculate the number of apples that fall from the tree due to the decay factor. Since d = 0.25, this means that 25% of the apples fall from the tree each week.

The number of apples that fall is given by:
Number of apples that fall = (d * x)
Number of apples that fall = (0.25 * 4)
Number of apples that fall = 1

Now, let's calculate the number of apples remaining after the decay:
Number of apples remaining = x - Number of apples that fall
Number of apples remaining = 4 - 1
Number of apples remaining = 3

Next, we add the new apples that grow on the tree:
Number of apples remaining = Number of apples remaining + z
Number of apples remaining = 3 + 3
Number of apples remaining = 6

Finally, we subtract the apples picked from the tree:
Number of apples remaining = Number of apples remaining - y
Number of apples remaining = 6 - 2
Number of apples remaining = 4

So, after one week, there are 4 apples remaining on the tree.",3.75,4,4
577,"We ordered 15 pizzas for a party. 5 pizzas have 8 slices each, 6 pizzas have 12 slices each, and the remaining pizzas have 16 slices each. What is the total number of slices in all the pizzas?","Let's calculate the total number of slices for each type of pizza:

1. For the 5 pizzas with 8 slices each:
5 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 40 slices

2. For the 6 pizzas with 12 slices each:
6 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 72 slices

3. For the remaining pizzas with 16 slices each, we first need to determine how many pizzas have 16 slices. We know there are 15 pizzas in total, and we've already accounted for 5 + 6 = 11 pizzas. So, there are 15 - 11 = 4 pizzas with 16 slices each.

4 pizzas * 16 slices per pizza = 64 slices

Now, let's add up all the slices from each type of pizza:

40 slices (from 8-slice pizzas) + 72 slices (from 12-slice pizzas) + 64 slices (from 16-slice pizzas) = 176 slices

578,"Lewis earns a total of $1216 during the harvest. His weekly earnings vary as follows: In the first week, he earns $16. For each subsequent week, his earnings increase by $8 per week. Additionally, Lewis incurs weekly deductions for equipment rental at a flat rate of $12 per week. How many weeks did the harvest last?","Let's denote the number of weeks the harvest lasted as \( n \).

Lewis's earnings start at $16 for the first week and increase by $8 each subsequent week. This forms an arithmetic sequence for his earnings before deductions. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \]

where \( a_n \) is the nth term, \( a_1 \) is the first term, \( n \) is the term number, and \( d \) is the common difference between the terms.

For Lewis's earnings, \( a_1 = 16 \) (earnings for the first week) and \( d = 8 \) (the amount by which his earnings increase each week).

The total earnings before deductions after \( n \) weeks would be the sum of the first \( n \) terms of this arithmetic sequence, which is given by the formula:

\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n - 1)d] \]

However, we must also account for the weekly deductions for equipment rental, which is a flat rate of $12 per week. So, the total deductions after \( n \) weeks would be:

\[ Deductions = 12n \]

Lewis's total earnings after deductions would then be:

\[ Total Earnings = S_n - Deductions \]

Given that Lewis's total earnings during the harvest are $1216, we can set up the equation:

\[ 1216 = \frac{n}{2} [2(16) + (n - 1)8] - 12n \]

Now, let's solve for \( n \):

\[ 1216 = \frac{n}{2} [32 + 8(n - 1)] - 12n \]
\[ 1216 = \frac{n}{2} [32 + 8n - 8] - 12n \]
\[ 1216 = \frac{n}{2} [24 + 8n] - 12n \]
\[ 1216 = 12n + 4n^2 - 12n \]
\[ 1216 = 4n^2 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( n^2 \):

\[ \frac{1216}{4} = n^2 \]
\[ 304 = n^2 \]

Now, take the square root of both sides to solve for \( n \):

\[ n = \sqrt{304} \]

Since the number of weeks must be a whole number, we need to find the nearest whole number to the square root of 304. The square root of 304 is approximately 17.43. Since we can't have a fraction of a week, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 17.

Therefore, the harvest lasted for 17 weeks.","Lewis's earnings start at $16 and increase by $8 each week. We also have a constant $12 deduction each week. 

Starting with week 1, we can calculate:

$16 ($16 + $8) ($24 + $8) ...

This can be simplified by noting each increase is $8, so:

$16 + $8x (where x is the number of weeks)

We also know the total earnings are $1216, so:

1216 = 16 + 8x

Therefore, x = 14. 

The harvest lasted fourteen weeks.

14.","Let's denote the number of weeks the harvest lasted as \( W \).

In the first week, Lewis earns $16. For each subsequent week, his earnings increase by $8 per week. So, in the second week, he earns $16 + $8 = $24. In the third week, he earns $24 + $8 = $32, and so on.

To find out how many weeks the harvest lasted, we need to calculate the total earnings for each week and then subtract the weekly deductions for equipment rental.

The total earnings for the first week are $16. For each subsequent week, his earnings increase by $8 per week, so the total earnings for the second week are $16 + $8 = $24, for the third week are $24 + $8 = $32, and so on.

Let's calculate the total earnings for each week:

- First week: $16
- Second week: $24
- Third week: $32
- Fourth week: $40
- Fifth week: $48
- Sixth week: $56

Now, let's subtract the weekly deductions for equipment rental:

- First week: $16 - $12 = $4
- Second week: $24 - $12 = $12
- Third week: $32 - $12 = $20
- Fourth week: $40 - $12 = $28
- Fifth week: $48 - $12 = $36
- Sixth week: $56 - $12 = $44

Now, let's add up the total earnings for each week after subtracting the deductions:

- First week: $4
- Second week: $12
- Third week: $20
- Fourth week: $28
- Fifth week: $36
- Sixth week: $44

The total earnings after deductions for each week are:

- First week: $4
- Second week: $12
- Third week: $20
- Fourth week: $28
- Fifth week: $36
- Sixth week: $44

Now, let's add up all the earnings after deductions to see if they match the total earnings Lewis made during the harvest:

Total earnings after deductions = $4 + $12 + $20 + $28 + $36 + $44 = $144

Since Lewis earned a total of $1216 during the harvest, we need to find out how many weeks it took to earn $144 (the total earnings after deductions).

If there are a total of 20 peaches in all baskets, how many green peaches are in each basket?","Let's denote the number of green peaches in the first basket as G1, in the second basket as G2, and in the third basket as G3.

From the information given, we can set up the following equation:

(4 red + G1 green) + (4 red + G2 green) + (3 red + G3 green) = 20 peaches

Combining the red peaches, we have:

4 + 4 + 3 + G1 + G2 + G3 = 20

11 + G1 + G2 + G3 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of green peaches (G1 + G2 + G3):

G1 + G2 + G3 = 20 - 11

G1 + G2 + G3 = 9

Since the problem does not provide specific information about the distribution of green peaches in each basket, we can only determine the total number of green peaches, which is 9. Without additional information, we cannot determine the exact number of green peaches in each individual basket.","Let's use x to represent the number of green peaches in each of the first two baskets, and y for the third basket.

We know that:
4 red + x = the number of peaches in the first two baskets.
3 red + y = the number of peaches in the third basket.

Adding these equations gives:
7 red + x + y = total number of peaches.

We're told the total number of peaches is 20, so:
7 + x + y = 20

Subtracting 7 from both sides:
x + y = 13

The third basket has 3 red peaches.

The total number of peaches in all baskets is 20. So, the total number of green peaches in all baskets is 20 - (8 + 3) = 20 - 11 = 9 green peaches.

Now, we need to distribute these 9 green peaches among the three baskets. Since we don't have the exact number of green peaches in each basket, we can only say that the total number of green peaches is 9.

After all the purchases, he has $3 left with him. How much money did he have initially in Euros?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the candy bars. The first and third candy bars cost $2 each, so that's $4. The second candy bar has a 10% discount, so it costs $2 - (10% of $2).

10% of $2 is $0.20, so the second candy bar costs $2 - $0.20 = $1.80.

Now, let's add up the cost of all three candy bars: $4 (for the first and third) + $1.80 (for the second) = $5.80.

Dan has $3 left after buying the candy bars, so before buying them, he had $5.80 + $3 = $8.80.

Now, we need to convert this amount from US dollars to Euros. We know that 1 Euro equals $1.12. To find out how many Euros Dan had initially, we divide the total amount in dollars by the exchange rate:

$8.80 / $1.12 = 7.8571 Euros (rounded to four decimal places).

So, Dan initially had approximately 7.86 Euros.","Dan first exchanged an unknown amount of Euros into US dollars. We'll call the amount of Euros A.
$A * $1.12 = $3 + (3 * $2) + ($2 * 0.90)
Solving for A gives us A = $14.

The initial amount Dan had in Euros was $14.","Let's calculate the total cost of the candy bars first.

The first candy bar costs $2.
The second candy bar costs $2 - 10% of $2 = $2 - $0.20 = $1.80.
The third candy bar costs $2.

So, the total cost of the candy bars is $2 + $1.80 + $2 = $6.

Now, let's find out how much money Dan had initially in Euros.

We know that after all the purchases, he has $3 left. This means that the total amount he had initially was $3 + $6 (the cost of the candy bars) = $9.

Since 1 Euro equals $1.12, we can find out how much money Dan had initially in Euros by dividing $9 by $1.12.

$9 ÷ $1.12 = $8.

Number of crayons given to friends: 7,255
Number of crayons lost: 3,689

7,255 - 3,689 = 3,566

Paul gave 3,566 more crayons to his friends than he lost.","Paul gave 7,255 crayons to his friends and lost 3,689, which means he shared 3,566 more crayons than he lost.

584,"Allan, Jake, and Lucy went to the park. Allan initially brought 'x' balloons, while Jake brought (x + 2) balloons, and Lucy brought (2x - 1) balloons. At the park, Allan bought 'y' more balloons and Lucy gave away half of her balloons. How many balloons did Allan, Jake, and Lucy have in total at the park after these changes?","Let's calculate the number of balloons each person has after the changes.

Allan initially had 'x' balloons and bought 'y' more, so he now has:
x + y balloons

Jake did not buy or give away any balloons, so he still has:
x + 2 balloons

Lucy initially had (2x - 1) balloons and gave away half of them, so she now has half of what she started with:
(2x - 1) / 2 balloons

To find the total number of balloons they have together after the changes, we add up the number of balloons each person has:
Total balloons = Allan's balloons + Jake's balloons + Lucy's balloons
Total balloons = (x + y) + (x + 2) + ((2x - 1) / 2)

Now, let's simplify the expression:
Total balloons = x + y + x + 2 + x - 0.5
Total balloons = 3x + y + 1.5

So, Allan, Jake, and Lucy have a total of 3x + y + 1.5 balloons at the park after the changes.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Allan brought 'x' balloons, Jake brought x + 2, and Lucy brought 2x - 1. Adding these equations gives us 4x + 1 as the total number of balloons they had when they arrived at the park.

2. Allan bought 'y' more balloons, adding another y to the total: 4x + 1 + y.

3. Lucy gave away half of her balloons, which were 2x - 1. After her donation, Lucy has half of that amount, or x - 1/2, left.

4. The new total is 4x + 1 + y + (2x - 1) + (x - 1/2) = 7x + 1 + y.

Therefore, the final answer is 7x + y.

Wow! That's a lot of balloons.","Initially, Allan had x balloons, Jake had x + 2 balloons, and Lucy had 2x - 1 balloons. So, the total number of balloons they had initially is:

x (Allan's balloons) + (x + 2) (Jake's balloons) + (2x - 1) (Lucy's balloons)

To add these together, we first need to make sure the terms have the same base. Since x is the base, we can rewrite Jake's and Lucy's balloons in terms of x:

x (Allan's balloons) + (x + 2) (Jake's balloons) + (2x - 1) (Lucy's balloons)
= x + x + 2 + 2x - 1
= 3x + 2

Now, Allan bought y more balloons, so his total number of balloons became:

x + y

Lucy gave away half of her balloons, so her total number of balloons became:

(2x - 1) / 2 = x - 1/2

Now, let's add up the total number of balloons each person has:

Allan's balloons + Jake's balloons + Lucy's balloons
= (x + y) + (3x + 2) + (x - 1/2)
= (x + y) + (4x + 2) + (x - 1/2)
= (x + y) + (5x + 2) - (1/2)

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 2:

= (x + y) + (5x + 2) - (1/2)
= (x + y) + (5x + 2) - (1/2)
= (x + y) + (5x + 2) + (1/2)
= (x + y) + (5x + 2 + 1/2)
= (x + y) + (5x + 2.5)
= (x + y) + (5.5x + 2.5)
= (x + y) + (8x + 5)
= (x + y + 8x) + (5)
= (9x + y) + 5

So, the total number of balloons Allan, Jake, and Lucy have in total at the park after these changes is 9x + y + 5.",7x + y,ninex plus y plus five,3x + y + 1.5
585,"David did 510 push-ups in gym class today. He did 210 more push-ups than Zachary, and 132 more push-ups than Emily. Find the average number of push-ups done by David, Zachary, and Emily altogether.","To find the average number of push-ups done by David, Zachary, and Emily, we first need to find out how many push-ups Zachary and Emily did.

David did 210 more push-ups than Zachary, so:
Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups - 210
Zachary's push-ups = 510 - 210
Zachary's push-ups = 300

David did 132 more push-ups than Emily, so:
Emily's push-ups = David's push-ups - 132
Emily's push-ups = 510 - 132
Emily's push-ups = 378

Now we can find the total number of push-ups done by all three:
Total push-ups = David's push-ups + Zachary's push-ups + Emily's push-ups
Total push-ups = 510 + 300 + 378
Total push-ups = 1188

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of people:
Average push-ups = Total push-ups / Number of people
Average push-ups = 1188 / 3
Average push-ups = 396

So, the average number of push-ups done by David, Zachary, and Emily altogether is 396.","Let's analyze this situation step by step:

1. David's push-ups: 510

2. David did 210 push-ups more than Zachary, so Zachary did: 510 - 210 = 300

3. Emily was able to do 132 push-ups less than David, so she did: 510 - 132 = 378

4. Now, we have the total numbers of push-ups from all three individuals:
David: 510
Zachary: 300
Emily: 378

5. Adding them together, we get: 510 + 300 + 378 = 1188

6. The average number of push-ups is calculated by dividing the total number by the number of people: 1188 / 3 = 402

So, the average number of push-ups done by David, Zachary, and Emily is **402**.","Let's denote the number of push-ups done by Zachary as Z and the number of push-ups done by Emily as E.

According to the information given, David did 510 push-ups, and he did 210 more push-ups than Zachary. So we can write:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 210
510 = Z + 210

Now, let's solve for Z:

510 = Z + 210
Z = 510 - 210
Z = 300

Now we know that Zachary did 300 push-ups.

Next, we are told that David did 132 more push-ups than Emily. So we can write:

David's push-ups = Emily's push-ups + 132
510 = E + 132

Now, let's solve for E:

510 = E + 132
E = 510 - 132
E = 378

Now we know that Emily did 378 push-ups.

To find the average number of push-ups done by David, Zachary, and Emily altogether, we add up the number of push-ups done by each person and then divide by the total number of people:

Average = (David's push-ups + Zachary's push-ups + Emily's push-ups) / Total number of people
Average = (510 + 300 + 378) / 3
Average = 1288 / 3
Average = 429.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

So the average number of push-ups done by David, Zachary, and Emily altogether is approximately 429.33.",402,429.33,396

587,"Let's call the initial marbles Josh has m1, where m1 is a fraction of his total collection. Josh found f marbles, which is a fraction of the marbles he initially had. He lost l marbles, which is also a fraction of the marbles he initially had. If the total number of initial marbles is unknown, how many more marbles did Josh lose (l) than those he found (f), given the relationships for m1, f, and l?","Let's denote the total number of initial marbles as T. According to the problem, Josh initially has m1 * T marbles.

He found f * (m1 * T) marbles, because f is a fraction of the marbles he initially had.

He lost l * (m1 * T) marbles, because l is a fraction of the marbles he initially had.

To find out how many more marbles Josh lost (l) than those he found (f), we need to calculate the difference between the number of marbles lost and found:

Number of marbles lost - Number of marbles found = l * (m1 * T) - f * (m1 * T)

We can factor out (m1 * T) since it is common to both terms:

= (m1 * T) * (l - f)

This expression represents the difference in the number of marbles lost and found in terms of the total number of initial marbles T, the initial fraction m1, and the fractions of marbles lost (l) and found (f).

If we want to find the difference in terms of the number of marbles, we can simplify the expression further by removing the (m1 * T) since the question asks for the relationship between l and f, not the actual number of marbles:

Difference = l - f

This means that Josh lost (l - f) times the number of marbles he initially had more than he found. If l > f, then Josh lost more marbles than he found. If l = f, then the number of marbles lost and found is the same. If l < f, then Josh found more marbles than he lost.","We're trying to find the difference between the marbles Josh lost and those he found, which we'll represent as Δ = l - f. 

Since the number of initial marbles, m1, is unknown, we can't simply subtract f from l. However, we know that both f and l are fractions of m1. We can express the solution as: 

Δ = l - f = (a/b) * m1 - (c/d) * m1

Where a/b is the fraction representing lost marbles l, and c/d is the fraction for found marbles f. To solve for Δ, we can multiply both sides by m1, leading to: 

Δ * m1 = l * m1 - f * m1

Since m1 is the total number of marbles Josh initially had, the right-hand side of the equation above evaluates to l - f, which is exactly Δ. Therefore, we get: 

Δ * m1 = Δ

This reveals that Δ is independent of the total number of marbles Josh initially had (m1), and thus we can solve it without that information.

The result is: 

**Δ = l - f**","Given the relationships for m1, f, and l, we can express each as a fraction of the total number of initial marbles. Let's denote the total number of initial marbles as T.

m1 = fraction of total marbles Josh initially had
f = fraction of the marbles he initially had that he found
l = fraction of the marbles he initially had that he lost

We can express each fraction as a decimal by dividing the number of marbles by the total number of marbles (T):

m1 = m1 / T
f = f / T
l = l / T

Now, we can express the difference between the marbles Josh lost and the marbles he found as a fraction of the total number of initial marbles:

l - f = (l / T) - (f / T)

To find out how many more marbles Josh lost than those he found, we need to subtract the fraction of the marbles he found from the fraction of the marbles he lost:

l - f = (l / T) - (f / T)
l - f = (l - f) / T

Since we don't know the total number of initial marbles (T), we cannot calculate the exact number of marbles Josh lost more than those he found. However, we can express the difference as a fraction of the total number of initial marbles.",Δ = l - f,(l - f) / T,l - f

589,Edward had $18. He spent $16.35 on an item and had to pay an additional 7.5% sales tax on the purchase. How much money does Edward have now after accounting for both the item cost and sales tax?,"First, let's calculate the sales tax on the item.

Sales tax = Item cost x Sales tax rate
Sales tax = $16.35 x 7.5%
Sales tax = $16.35 x 0.075 (since 7.5% is the same as 7.5/100 or 0.075)
Sales tax = $1.22625

Since sales tax is generally rounded to the nearest cent, the sales tax would be $1.23.

Now, let's add the sales tax to the item cost to find the total cost of the item.

Total cost = Item cost + Sales tax
Total cost = $16.35 + $1.23
Total cost = $17.58

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from Edward's original amount to find out how much money he has left.

Money left = Original amount - Total cost
Money left = $18.00 - $17.58
Money left = $0.42

Edward has $0.42 left after accounting for both the item cost and sales tax.","Edward initially had $18. He spent $16.35 on the item, and with a 7.5% sales tax, this would bring the total cost to $17.51.

Money: $0.49","First, let's calculate the sales tax Edward had to pay. The sales tax is 7.5% of the item cost, which is:

7.5% of $16.35 = 0.075 * $16.35 = $1.22625

Since we can't have a fraction of a cent, we'll round the sales tax to the nearest cent, which is $1.23.

Now, let's add the item cost and the sales tax to find out how much Edward spent in total:

$16.35 (item cost) + $1.23 (sales tax) = $17.58

On Monday, she had 10 bags of cans. She found 3 bags of cans on Tuesday and 7 bags of cans on Wednesday. 

Determine the total amount of money Tiffany would earn when she recycles all the cans she collected during these three days.","To determine the total amount of money Tiffany would earn, we first need to calculate the total number of cans she collected over the three days.

On Monday, she had 10 bags of cans.
On Tuesday, she found 3 more bags.
On Wednesday, she found 7 more bags.

Total number of bags = Monday's bags + Tuesday's bags + Wednesday's bags
Total number of bags = 10 + 3 + 7
Total number of bags = 20

Since each bag consists of 'c' number of cans, the total number of cans Tiffany collected is:
Total cans = Total number of bags * Number of cans per bag
Total cans = 20 * c

The recycling center pays $0.10 per can, so the total amount of money Tiffany would earn is:
Total money earned = Total cans * Money per can
Total money earned = 20c * $0.10
Total money earned = 2c dollars

Therefore, Tiffany would earn 2c dollars for recycling all the cans she collected during the three days.","Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that each bag contains a certain number of cans, and we denote this number as $c$. The recycling center pays $0.10 for each can.

On Monday, Tiffany collected 10 x c cans.
On Tuesday, she collected 3 x c cans.
And on Wednesday, she gathered 7 x c cans.

To find the total number of cans, we simply add these up:
10c + 3c + 7c = 20c.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Tiffany will earn:
20c × $0.10 = $2.

So, Tiffany would earn **two dollars** when recycling all the cans.","To calculate the total amount of money Tiffany would earn, we need to multiply the number of cans in each bag by the price per can and then add up the results.

On Monday, she had 10 bags of cans, so she would earn:
10 bags * $0.10 per can = $1.00 per bag
$1.00 per bag * 10 bags = $10.00

On Tuesday, she found 3 bags of cans, so she would earn:
3 bags * $0.10 per can = $0.30 per bag
$0.30 per bag * 3 bags = $0.90

On Wednesday, she found 7 bags of cans, so she would earn:
7 bags * $0.10 per can = $0.70 per bag
$0.70 per bag * 7 bags = $4.90

Now, we add up the earnings from all three days:
$10.00 (Monday) + $0.90 (Tuesday) + $4.90 (Wednesday) = $15.80

Total birds from migrating families = 1032 birds

To find the total number of birds from the families that stayed behind, we do a similar calculation:

Total birds from families that stayed = 45 families × 8 birds/family
Total birds from families that stayed = 360 birds

Now, we calculate the difference in the total number of birds between the families that migrated and those that stayed:

- Total pencils: 5 pencils/row * 10 rows = 50 pencils
- Total pens: 3 pens/row * 8 rows = 24 pens
- Total crayons: 7 crayons/row * 5 rows = 35 crayons
- Total markers: 2 markers/row * 7 rows = 14 markers

Since Faye has 50 pencils, 24 pens, 35 crayons, and 14 markers, and these numbers match the total number of each type of writing utensil she can put in rows without having any remaining single-type writing utensils, she can make 10 complete rows without having any remaining single-type writing utensils.",12,10,Five.

After the weekend, Fred had 277 dollars, Jason had 225 dollars, and Lucy had 410 dollars. How much money did each person earn through their individual tasks?","To find out how much money each person earned, we need to subtract the amount of money they had last week from the amount they have after the weekend.

Fred earned = 277 dollars (after the weekend) - 250 dollars (last week) = 27 dollars

Jason earned = 225 dollars (after the weekend) - 180 dollars (last week) = 45 dollars

Lucy earned = 410 dollars (after the weekend) - 330 dollars (last week) = 80 dollars

So, Fred earned 27 dollars, Jason earned 45 dollars, and Lucy earned 80 dollars through their individual tasks over the weekend.","Let's solve this step by step. We will find the earnings of each person by subtracting their previous amount from their current amount.

Fred earned 27 - 250 = 22 dollars.

Jason earned 225 - 180 = 45 dollars.

Lucy earned 410 - 330 = 80 dollars.

So, the total earnings are 22 + 45 + 80 = **147** dollars.","Let's denote the amount of money each person earned as follows:

Fred's earnings = F
Jason's earnings = J
Lucy's earnings = L

We know the amount of money each person had before the weekend and the amount they had after the weekend. We can set up equations based on these amounts to find the earnings for each person.

For Fred:
Before the weekend, Fred had $250. After the weekend, he had $277. So, Fred earned:
F = $277 - $250 = $27

For Jason:
Before the weekend, Jason had $180. After the weekend, he had $225. So, Jason earned:
J = $225 - $180 = $45

For Lucy:
Before the weekend, Lucy had $330. After the weekend, she had $410. So, Lucy earned:
L = $410 - $330 = $80

Now we have the earnings for each person:
F = $27
J = $45
L = $80

Jake's red balloons: 100
Jake's blue balloons: 50
Jake's green balloons: 45

Total balloons Jake brought to the park: 100 (red) + 50 (blue) + 45 (green) = 195 balloons

To find out how many more balloons Allan distributed than Jake, we subtract the total number of balloons Jake brought from the total number of balloons Allan brought:

Allan's balloons - Jake's balloons = 230 - 195 = 35 balloons

Allan distributed 35 more balloons at the park than Jake, considering the forgotten balloons.","Allan has a total of 225 balloons: 150 red, 75 blue, and 30 green. But he forgot 25 blue balloons, so he actually has 200 balloons.

First tower: 63 blocks
Second tower: 40 blocks
Third tower: 27 blocks

Total blocks for towers = 63 + 40 + 27 = 130 blocks

Now, let's compare this to the number of blocks he used to build the house:

Blocks for the house: 89 blocks

To find out how many more blocks he used to build the house than he did to build all the towers combined, we subtract the total blocks for the towers from the blocks for the house:

89 (house) - 130 (towers) = -41

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the question because you can't use more blocks for the house than for all the towers combined if the number of blocks used for the towers is greater than the number of blocks used for the house.

There is a 15% discount on the chocolate, and an 8% sales tax applied to the total amount of the gum and candy bar purchases. How much more money did he spend on the chocolate than he did on the candy bar after taking into account the discount and tax?","First, let's calculate the discounted price of the chocolate. The original price of the chocolate is $7, and it has a 15% discount.

Discount on chocolate = 15% of $7
= (15/100) * $7
= 0.15 * $7
= $1.05

So, the discounted price of the chocolate is:
$7 - $1.05 = $5.95

Next, let's calculate the total amount of the gum and candy bar purchases before tax:
Gum + Candy bar = $3 + $2 = $5

Now, let's calculate the sales tax on the gum and candy bar:
Sales tax = 8% of $5
= (8/100) * $5
= 0.08 * $5
= $0.40

So, the total amount for the gum and candy bar after tax is:
$5 + $0.40 = $5.40

Now, let's calculate how much more Dan spent on the chocolate than on the candy bar after taking into account the discount and tax. Since we only need to compare the chocolate to the candy bar, we can ignore the gum and soda for this calculation.

The candy bar cost $2, and the chocolate cost $5.95 after the discount. The difference in cost is:
$5.95 (chocolate) - $2 (candy bar) = $3.95

Therefore, Dan spent $3.95 more on the chocolate than he did on the candy bar after taking into account the discount and tax.","Dan spent $6 on the chocolate and $2 on the candy bar.

After the 15% discount, the chocolate cost $5.95. 

The 8% sales tax on the gum and candy bar equates to $0.24. 

So, the total for the chocolate is higher at $5.95 vs. $2.24 for the candy bar. 

$3.71","First, let's calculate the discount on the chocolate:

Discount on chocolate = 15% of $7
Discount on chocolate = 0.15 * $7
Discount on chocolate = $1.05

Now, let's calculate the total amount Dan spent on the chocolate after the discount:

Total on chocolate = $7 - $1.05
Total on chocolate = $5.95

Next, let's calculate the sales tax on the gum and candy bar:

Sales tax on gum and candy bar = 8% of ($3 + $2)
Sales tax on gum and candy bar = 0.08 * ($5)
Sales tax on gum and candy bar = $0.40

Now, let's add the sales tax to the total amount Dan spent on the gum and candy bar:

Total on gum and candy bar = $3 + $2 + $0.40
Total on gum and candy bar = $5.40

Finally, let's find out how much more money Dan spent on the chocolate than he did on the candy bar after taking into account the discount and tax:

Emily, on the other hand, made custom art pieces and was able to increase her money by 40%. After they all earned their extra money, Fred and Jason decided to help Emily with a project, and they each gave her 25% of their new total. How much money did Jason originally earn by delivering newspapers?","First, let's calculate how much money each person earned over the weekend.

Fred had $49 and increased his money by a factor of 1.5:
Fred's earnings = $49 * 1.5 = $73.5

Jason had $3 and increased his money by 62.5%:
Jason's earnings = $3 * 0.625 = $1.875

Emily had $25 and increased her money by 40%:
Emily's earnings = $25 * 0.40 = $10

Now, let's find out how much money each person had after earning their extra money.

Fred's new total = $49 + $73.5 = $122.5
Jason's new total = $3 + $1.875 = $4.875
Emily's new total = $25 + $10 = $35

Next, Fred and Jason each gave Emily 25% of their new total.

Fred's contribution to Emily = $122.5 * 0.25 = $30.625
Jason's contribution to Emily = $4.875 * 0.25 = $1.21875

Now, we need to find out how much money Jason originally earned by delivering newspapers. We already calculated Jason's earnings from delivering newspapers as $1.875.

Therefore, Jason originally earned $1.875 by delivering newspapers.","Let's break this scenario down into a series of steps to solve the mystery of Jason's original earnings:

1. Fred started with $49, Jason with $3, and Emily with $25.

2. After their respective money-making endeavors, Fred has $49 * 1.5 = $73.50, Jason has $3 * 1.625 = $4.88, and Emily has $25 * 1.4 = $35.

3. Fred and Jason decide to be super helpful and give 25% of their newfound wealth to Emily. So, Emily receives $73.50 * 0.25 = $18.38 and $4.88 * 0.25 = $1.22.

4. Emily's total money after this kind gesture is $35 + $18.38 + $1.22 = $54.50.

5. We now have enough information to calculate Jason's original earnings. $54.50 (Emily's final total) - $35 (Emily's starting total) = $19.50 was the amount contributed by Fred and Jason after their contributions.

6. As Jason contributed 25% of his new total, his contribution was $19.50 * 4 = $78. His original earnings from delivering newspapers were therefore $78 / 1.625 = $48.

So, the final result is 48.","First, let's calculate the new amount of money each person has after earning their extra money.

Fred started with $49 and increased his money by a factor of 1.5. To calculate his new total, we multiply his original amount by the factor:

Fred's new total = $49 * 1.5 = $73.5

Jason started with $3 and increased his money by 62.5%. To calculate his new total, we multiply his original amount by the factor:

Jason's new total = $3 * 1.625 = $4.875

Emily started with $25 and increased her money by 40%. To calculate her new total, we multiply her original amount by the factor:

Emily's new total = $25 * 1.4 = $35

Now, let's calculate how much money Jason originally earned by delivering newspapers. We know that after earning his extra money, Jason gave Emily 25% of his new total. To find out how much he originally earned, we subtract the amount he gave Emily from his new total:

Jason's original earnings = Jason's new total - (25% of Jason's new total)
Jason's original earnings = $4.875 - (0.25 * $4.875)
Jason's original earnings = $4.875 - $1.21875
Jason's original earnings = $3.65625

Since Jason's original earnings can't be a fraction of a dollar, we'll round it to the nearest cent:

Jason's original earnings = $3.66

So, Jason originally earned $3.66 by delivering newspapers.",48,3.66,$1.875

In the third and final round, the grasshopper jumped 5 inches less than its first jump, the frog maintained its second-round jump distance, and the cricket jumped double the distance it jumped in the second round. What were the individual jump distances for each participant in each round?","Let's calculate the jump distances for each participant in each round.

**Round 1:**
- Grasshopper: 13 inches
- Frog: The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, so the frog jumped 13 - 2 = 11 inches.
- Cricket: We don't have information about the cricket's jump in the first round yet.

**Round 2:**
- Frog: The frog improved its jump by 3 inches, so the frog jumped 11 + 3 = 14 inches.
- Cricket: The cricket jumped 1 inch less than the frog, so the cricket jumped 14 - 1 = 13 inches.
- Grasshopper: We don't have information about the grasshopper's jump in the second round yet.

**Round 3:**
- Grasshopper: The grasshopper jumped 5 inches less than its first jump, so the grasshopper jumped 13 - 5 = 8 inches.
- Frog: The frog maintained its second-round jump distance, so the frog jumped 14 inches again.
- Cricket: The cricket jumped double the distance it jumped in the second round, so the cricket jumped 13 * 2 = 26 inches.

Now we have all the jump distances for each participant in each round:

**Grasshopper:**
- Round 1: 13 inches
- Round 2: Not specified, but it doesn't change from round 1 since there's no mention of improvement or decrease.
- Round 3: 8 inches

**Cricket:**
- Round 1: Not specified, but it doesn't change from round 2 since there's no mention of improvement or decrease.
- Round 2: 13 inches
- Round 3: 26 inches

So, the cricket's jump in the first round would be the same as in the second round, which is 13 inches, and the grasshopper's jump in the second round would be the same as in the first round, which is 13 inches, since there's no information given about changes in their performances in the second round.","1. In the first round, the grasshopper jumped 13 inches, and the frog jumped 11 inches (13 - 2).

3. In the third round, the grasshopper jumped 8 inches (13 - 5), the frog maintained a jump of 14 inches, and the cricket jumped 26 inches (13 x 2).

Therefore, the total jump distances are: Grasshopper - 31 inches, Frog - 28 inches, and Cricket - 39 inches.

The final result is three.","Let's denote the frog's jump in the first round as F1. According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog in the first round, so the grasshopper's jump in the first round is F1 + 2 inches.

In the second round, the frog improved its jump by 3 inches, so its jump in the second round is F1 + 3 inches. The cricket jumped 1 inch less than the frog in the second round, so the cricket's jump in the second round is F1 + 3 inches - 1 inch = F1 + 2 inches.

In the third round, the grasshopper jumped 5 inches less than its first jump, so its jump in the third round is F1 + 2 inches - 5 inches = F1 - 3 inches. The frog maintained its second-round jump distance, so its jump in the third round is F1 + 3 inches. The cricket jumped double the distance it jumped in the second round, so its jump in the third round is F1 + 2 inches * 2 = F1 + 4 inches.

Now we can find the individual jump distances for each participant in each round:

Grasshopper's jumps:
First round: F1 + 2 inches
Second round: F1 + 3 inches
Third round: F1 - 3 inches

Frog's jumps:
First round: F1 inches
Second round: F1 + 3 inches
Third round: F1 + 3 inches

Cricket's jumps:
First round: F1 - 1 inch
Second round: F1 + 2 inches
Third round: F1 + 4 inches

We still need to find the value of F1, the frog's jump in the first round. We can use the information that the grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog in the first round to find F1.

The grasshopper's jump in the first round is F1 + 2 inches, and we know that the grasshopper jumped 13 inches in the first round. So, we can set up the equation:

F1 + 2 inches = 13 inches

Now, we solve for F1:

F1 = 13 inches - 2 inches
F1 = 11 inches

Now we have the value of F1, and we can find the individual jump distances for each participant in each round:

Then, Jane came over and ate 50 pieces. So, we subtract those from the remaining amount:
210 - 50 = 160 pieces

Bobby has 160 pieces of candy left.","Bobby started with 350 pieces of candy, which he then reduced by eating 2/5 of. This can be calculated as: 350 * 2/5 = 140 pieces.

607,"During Paul's birthday, he received a box of erasers and crayons. The box contained 457 erasers (307 regular and 150 jumbo) and 617 crayons (317 standard and 300 jumbo). Throughout the school year, he managed to keep all the jumbo erasers but lost 52 regular erasers. As for the crayons, Paul only used 123 standard crayons and 198 jumbo crayons. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left by the end of the school year?","Let's calculate the number of erasers and crayons Paul had left at the end of the school year.

Starting with erasers:
Paul started with 307 regular erasers and lost 52 of them. So, he had:
307 - 52 = 255 regular erasers left.

He kept all 150 jumbo erasers, so he still had:
150 jumbo erasers.

In total, Paul had:
255 regular erasers + 150 jumbo erasers = 405 erasers left.

Now, let's calculate the crayons:
Paul started with 317 standard crayons and used 123 of them. So, he had:
317 - 123 = 194 standard crayons left.

He started with 300 jumbo crayons and used 198 of them. So, he had:
300 - 198 = 102 jumbo crayons left.

In total, Paul had:
194 standard crayons + 102 jumbo crayons = 296 crayons left.

To find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left, we subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons:
296 crayons - 405 erasers = -109.

Since the result is negative, it means Paul had 109 more erasers than crayons left by the end of the school year.","Paul initially had 307 regular and 150 jumbo erasers, which total 457 erasers. At the end of the school year, he had 307 - 52 = 255 regular erasers left.

In this school, 60% of boys in grade 1 and 50% of boys in grade 2 are part of the soccer club, while 75% of girls in grade 1 and 80% of girls in grade 2 are part of the dance club. Calculate the total number of students in the school, and find out how many more girls than boys participate in the extracurricular activities (soccer and dance clubs combined).","First, let's calculate the total number of students in each grade after the new girls joined.

For grade 1:
- Girls: 632 (original) + 465 (new) = 1097 girls
- Boys: 410 boys (no new boys joined)

For grade 2:
- Girls: 537 (original) + 372 (new) = 909 girls
- Boys: 325 boys (no new boys joined)

Now, let's calculate the total number of students in the school by adding the numbers for both grades.

Total students in grade 1 = 1097 girls + 410 boys = 1507 students
Total students in grade 2 = 909 girls + 325 boys = 1234 students

Total students in the school = 1507 (grade 1) + 1234 (grade 2) = 2741 students

Next, let's calculate the number of boys and girls participating in the extracurricular activities.

For grade 1:
- Boys in soccer club: 60% of 410 = 0.60 * 410 = 246 boys
- Girls in dance club: 75% of 1097 = 0.75 * 1097 = 822.75, but since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to 822 girls

For grade 2:
- Boys in soccer club: 50% of 325 = 0.50 * 325 = 162.5, but since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to 162 boys
- Girls in dance club: 80% of 909 = 0.80 * 909 = 727.2, but since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to 727 girls

Now, let's calculate the total number of boys and girls in the extracurricular activities.

Total boys in clubs = 246 (grade 1 soccer) + 162 (grade 2 soccer) = 408 boys
Total girls in clubs = 822 (grade 1 dance) + 727 (grade 2 dance) = 1549 girls

Finally, let's find out how many more girls than boys participate in the extracurricular activities.

More girls than boys = Total girls in clubs - Total boys in clubs
More girls than boys = 1549 girls - 408 boys = 1141 more girls

In summary, there are a total of 2741 students in the school, and there are 1141 more girls than boys participating in the extracurricular activities (soccer and dance clubs combined).","Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students in each grade.
- Grade 1: 632 girls + 410 boys = 1042 students
- Grade 2: 537 girls + 325 boys = 862 students

Step 2: Add the new girls who joined.
- Grade 1: 465 new girls
- Grade 2: 372 new girls

Step 3: Calculate the total number of students.
- Grade 1 now has 1042 students + 465 new girls = 1507 students
- Grade 2 now has 862 students + 372 new girls = 1234 students

Step 4: Calculate the number of students participating in extracurricular activities.
- Boys in Grade 1: 60% of 410 = 0.6 * 410 = 246 boys
- Boys in Grade 2: 50% of 325 = 0.5 * 325 = 162.5 boys
- Girls in Grade 1: 75% of 632 = 0.75 * 632 = 474 girls
- Girls in Grade 2: 80% of 537 = 0.8 * 537 = 429.6 girls

Step 5: Find the total number of students participating in extracurricular activities.
- Total boys = 246 + 162.5 = 408.5 boys
- Total girls = 474 + 429.6 = 898.4 girls

- 898.4 girls - 408.5 boys = 489.9 more girls

Result: 490.","Let's calculate the total number of students in the school first.

In grade 1, there are 632 girls and 410 boys. After 465 more girls join, the number of girls in grade 1 becomes:

Finally, for the small planks, he needs 2 long nails and 1 short nail per plank. How many long and short nails does John need in total to secure all the planks to the house walls?","To calculate the total number of long and short nails John needs, we'll first calculate the number of nails required for each type of plank and then sum them up.

For the large planks:
- Long nails needed = 8 planks * 4 long nails/plank = 32 long nails
- Short nails needed = 8 planks * 3 short nails/plank = 24 short nails

For the medium planks:
- Long nails needed = 12 planks * 3 long nails/plank = 36 long nails
- Short nails needed = 12 planks * 2 short nails/plank = 24 short nails

For the small planks:
- Long nails needed = 15 planks * 2 long nails/plank = 30 long nails
- Short nails needed = 15 planks * 1 short nail/plank = 15 short nails

Now, we'll add up the nails needed for all the planks:

Total long nails needed = 32 (large) + 36 (medium) + 30 (small) = 98 long nails
Total short nails needed = 24 (large) + 24 (medium) + 15 (small) = 63 short nails

John needs a total of 98 long nails and 63 short nails to secure all the planks to the house walls.","Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, calculate the number of long nails needed for the large planks:
8 planks × 4 nails/plank = 32 long nails

Also, calculate the number of short nails required for the same planks:
8 planks × 3 nails/plank = 24 short nails

For the medium planks, we will need:
12 planks × 3 nails/plank = 36 long nails
12 planks × 2 nails/plank = 24 short nails

And for the small planks:
15 planks × 2 nails/plank = 30 long nails
15 planks × 1 nail/plank = 15 short nails

Now, add up the totals for both types of nails:
Long nails: 32 + 36 + 30 = 98
Short nails: 24 + 24 + 15 = 63

So, John will need a total of 98 long nails and 63 short nails to secure all the planks to the house walls.

Peace.","To calculate the total number of long and short nails John needs, we first need to determine the number of long and short nails per plank for each size of plank and then multiply that by the number of planks of each size.

- Number of large planks = 8

For the medium planks:
- Long nails per plank = 3
- Short nails per plank = 2
- Number of medium planks = 12

For the small planks:
- Long nails per plank = 2
- Short nails per plank = 1
- Number of small planks = 15

Now, let's calculate the total number of long and short nails for each size of plank:

For the large planks:
- Total long nails = 4 long nails/plank * 8 planks = 32 long nails
- Total short nails = 3 short nails/plank * 8 planks = 24 short nails

For the medium planks:
- Total long nails = 3 long nails/plank * 12 planks = 36 long nails
- Total short nails = 2 short nails/plank * 12 planks = 24 short nails

For the small planks:
- Total long nails = 2 long nails/plank * 15 planks = 30 long nails
- Total short nails = 1 short nail/plank * 15 planks = 15 short nails

Now, let's add up the total number of long and short nails for all the planks:

- Total long nails = 32 (from large planks) + 36 (from medium planks) + 30 (from small planks) = 98 long nails
- Total short nails = 24 (from large planks) + 24 (from medium planks) + 15 (from small planks) = 63 short nails

20 eggs ÷ 5 eggs/group = 4 groups of eggs

For the marbles:
Rebecca has 6 marbles and wants to split them into groups of 2.
6 marbles ÷ 2 marbles/group = 3 groups of marbles

97 - 56 = 41 salty cookies left.

Chocolate cookies:
Paco had 45 chocolate cookies and gave away half of them to his friend.
Half of 45 is 45 / 2 = 22.5, but since you can't have half a cookie, we'll assume he gave away 22 or 23 cookies. Let's assume he gave away 22 cookies (since it's the closest whole number to half of 45 without going over).
45 - 22 = 23 chocolate cookies left.

Now, Paco's friend gave him back a third of the chocolate cookies he received.

First friend:
Matthew gave 2/3 of his crackers to the first friend. So the first friend received:
100 crackers * (2/3) = 200/3 crackers
200/3 crackers = 66.67 crackers (approximately)

Since we're dealing with whole crackers, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, so the first friend received 66 crackers.

Second friend:
After giving away 66 crackers to the first friend, Matthew has:
100 crackers - 66 crackers = 34 crackers left

Now, he gives 18.5% of the remaining crackers to his second friend. So the second friend received:
34 crackers * 18.5% = 34 crackers * 0.185 = 6.29 crackers

Again, since we're dealing with whole crackers, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, so the second friend received 6 crackers.

Third friend:
After giving away crackers to the first and second friends, Matthew has:
34 crackers - 6 crackers = 28 crackers left

Matthew then gives the remaining 7 crackers to his third friend.

In summary:

- The third friend received 7 crackers.","Matthew initially had 100 crackers. He gave two-thirds of them away, which is 2/3 * 100 = 66 crackers. He then had 100 - 66 = 34 crackers left. From the remaining crackers, he gave 18.5% * 34 = 6.21 crackers to his second friend, rounding down to 6 crackers. This means that the third friend received the last 7 crackers.

His first friend received 66 crackers, the second 6, and the third 7.

Therefore, the final result is 70.","First, let's find out how many crackers Matthew gave to his first friend. Since he gave 2/3 of the crackers to his first friend, we can calculate that as follows:

2/3 * 100 = 66.67

Since we can't give a fraction of a cracker, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 67.

Now, let's find out how many crackers are left after giving 2/3 to his first friend:

100 - 67 = 33

Next, we need to find out how many crackers Matthew gave to his second friend. He gave 18.5% of the remaining crackers to his second friend, so we calculate that as follows:

18.5% * 33 = 0.185 * 33 = 6

Now, we know that after giving 6 crackers to his second friend, there are 33 - 6 = 27 crackers left.

Finally, we need to find out how many crackers are left after giving the remaining 7 crackers to his third friend:

27 - 7 = 20

Find an equation to represent these scenarios, and solve it to find the difference (Z) between the number of bottle caps he found at the park and those he threw away.","Let's start by setting up an equation based on the information given:

Initially, Danny had X bottle caps.
He threw away Y bottle caps.
He found 50 new bottle caps at the park.
Now he has 60 bottle caps in his collection.

The equation representing the scenario would be:

X - Y + 50 = 60

We want to find the difference (Z) between the number of bottle caps he found at the park and those he threw away. This difference can be represented as:

Z = 50 - Y

To find Z, we need to express Y in terms of X using the first equation:

X - Y = 60 - 50
X - Y = 10

Now we know that Y = X - 10. We can substitute this into the equation for Z:

Z = 50 - (X - 10)
Z = 50 - X + 10
Z = 60 - X

Since we don't have the initial number of bottle caps (X), we cannot find the exact value of Z. However, we have an equation that represents the difference (Z) between the number of bottle caps Danny found and those he threw away in terms of the initial number of bottle caps (X).","Let's use the following equation to represent the scenario: 

X - Y + 50 = 60

Substituting the known value of X (initial bottle caps) with 60, we get: 

60 - Y + 50 = 60

Now, simplifying and solving for Y, we find: 

Y = 10

The difference between the bottle caps Danny found at the park and those he threw away is 50 - 10 = **40**.","Let's denote the number of bottle caps Danny initially had as X, the number of bottle caps he threw away as Y, the number of bottle caps he found at the park as Z, and the total number of bottle caps he has now as T.

According to the information given, Danny initially had X bottle caps, and after throwing away Y bottle caps, he had 60 bottle caps left. This can be represented by the equation:

X - Y = 60

Danny then found 50 new bottle caps at the park, so the total number of bottle caps he has now is:

T = X - Y + Z

We know that T is 60, so we can substitute this into the equation:

60 = X - Y + Z

Now, we need to find the difference (Z) between the number of bottle caps he found at the park and those he threw away. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he threw away from the number of bottle caps he found:

Z = 50 - Y

Now we have two equations:

1) X - Y = 60
2) Z = 50 - Y

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of X, Y, and Z. Let's start by expressing Y in terms of X and Z:

From equation 2, we have:

Z = 50 - Y

Now we can substitute this expression for Z into equation 1:

60 = X - (50 - Y)
60 = X - 50 + Y
60 + 50 = X + Y
110 = X + Y

Now we have an equation with X and Y:

110 = X + Y

We can solve this equation by adding X and Y together and setting the result equal to 110:

X + Y = 110

Since we don't have the values of X and Y, we cannot solve for Z yet. We need more information about X and Y to solve for Z. If you can provide the values of X and Y, or if you have another equation involving X, Y, or Z, we can proceed with the solution. Otherwise, we cannot determine the difference (Z) between the number of bottle caps he found at the park and those he threw away with the information given.",40,110,Z = 60X
616,"The Razorback shop makes $76 dollars off each jersey, $204 off each t-shirt, $132 off each hoodie, and $48 off each hat. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 158 t-shirts, 2 jerseys, 75 hoodies, and 120 hats. How much money did they make from selling all these items?","To calculate the total money made from selling all these items, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by the amount of money made from each item and then add all the totals together.

For t-shirts:
158 t-shirts * $204 per t-shirt = $32,232

For jerseys:
2 jerseys * $76 per jersey = $152

For hoodies:
75 hoodies * $132 per hoodie = $9,900

For hats:
120 hats * $48 per hat = $5,760

Now, we add all the totals together:
$32,232 (from t-shirts) + $152 (from jerseys) + $9,900 (from hoodies) + $5,760 (from hats) = $48,044

The Razorback shop made $48,044 from selling all these items during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.","Let's calculate the total earnings of the Razorback shop:

1. Calculate the earnings from the t-shirts:
$204 x 158 = $32,232

2. Calculate the earnings from the jerseys:
$76 x 2 = $152

3. Calculate the earnings from the hoodies:
$132 x 75 = $9,900

4. Calculate the earnings from the hats:
$48 x 120 = $5,760

5. Add up the earnings from all items:
$32,232 + $152 + $9,900 + $5,760 = $48,044

The Razorback shop made **$48,044** from selling the game merchandise.","First, let's calculate the total amount of money the Razorback shop made from selling each type of item:

- T-shirts: 158 t-shirts * $204/t-shirt = $32,192
- Jerseys: 2 jerseys * $76/jersey = $152
- Hoodies: 75 hoodies * $132/hoodie = $9900
- Hats: 120 hats * $48/hat = $5760

Now, let's add up all the amounts to find the total amount of money made:

Total amount of money made = $32,192 (from t-shirts) + $152 (from jerseys) + $9900 (from hoodies) + $5760 (from hats)
Total amount of money made = $32,192 + $152 + $9900 + $5760
Total amount of money made = $58,004

How many pages does the book have altogether?","First, let's calculate the total number of pages for the first 10 chapters:

10 chapters * 61 pages per chapter = 610 pages

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages for chapters 11 to 20 with the missing pages:

10 chapters * 59 pages per chapter = 590 pages

58 + 65 + 62 + 63 + 64 + 57 + 66 + 60 + 59 + 67 = 621 pages

Finally, let's add up all the pages from the three different sections:

610 pages (chapters 1-10) + 590 pages (chapters 11-20) + 621 pages (chapters 21-31) = 1821 pages

Therefore, the book has a total of 1821 pages.","We'll break this book's page count calculation into three parts:
1. The first 10 chapters of 61 pages each: 10 x 61 = 610 pages

2. The middle 10 chapters of 59 pages each: 10 x 59 = 590 pages

3. The final 11 chapters with varying page counts: 58 + 65 + 62 + 63 + 64 + 57 + 66 + 60 + 59 + 67 = 546 pages

Adding these together, the total page count is: 610 + 590 + 546 = 1746 pages

The book has **1746 pages**.","First, let's calculate the total number of pages for the first 10 chapters:

For chapters 1 to 10, each chapter has 61 pages, so the total number of pages for these chapters is:

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages for chapters 11 to 20, which have 2 missing pages each:

For chapters 11 to 20, each chapter has 59 pages, so the total number of pages for these chapters is:
10 chapters * 59 pages/chapter = 590 pages

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages for chapters 21 to 31, which have different lengths:

For chapters 21 to 31, the pages per chapter are: 58, 65, 62, 63, 64, 57, 66, 60, 59, and 67.

618,Zachary did 15.5 push-ups in gym class today. David did 39.2 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9.3 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?,"First, let's find out how many push-ups David did. Since David did 39.2 more push-ups than Zachary, we add 39.2 to the number of push-ups Zachary did:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 39.2
David's push-ups = 15.5 + 39.2
David's push-ups = 54.7

Now, let's find out how many push-ups John did. Since John did 9.3 less push-ups than David, we subtract 9.3 from the number of push-ups David did:

John's push-ups = David's push-ups - 9.3
John's push-ups = 54.7 - 9.3
John's push-ups = 45.4

Finally, to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, we subtract John's push-ups from Zachary's push-ups:

More push-ups by Zachary = Zachary's push-ups - John's push-ups
More push-ups by Zachary = 15.5 - 45.4

However, this would give us a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context because we know Zachary did fewer push-ups than John. We need to reverse the subtraction:

More push-ups by Zachary = John's push-ups - Zachary's push-ups
More push-ups by Zachary = 45.4 - 15.5
More push-ups by Zachary = 29.9

So, John did 29.9 more push-ups than Zachary.","Let's analyze and solve the word problem step by step:

1. Zachary did 15.5 push-ups.
2. David did 39.2 push-ups more than Zachary, so 15.5 + 39.2 = 54.7 push-ups.
3. John did 9.3 push-ups less than David, so 54.7 - 9.3 = 45.4 push-ups.

4. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, we subtract John's push-ups from Zachary's: 15.5 - 9.3 = 6.2

Zachary did 6.2 more push-ups than John.

Now we know David did 54.7 push-ups.

Next, we find out how many push-ups John did. John did 9.3 push-ups less than David, so we subtract 9.3 from David's 54.7 push-ups:

54.7 - 9.3 = 45.4

Now we know John did 45.4 push-ups.

Finally, we find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John by subtracting John's push-ups from Zachary's push-ups:

17 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 136 slices of pizza

Next, we have the burgers and hotdogs, which are considered one piece each:

24 burgers + 30 hotdogs = 54 pieces

Now, let's calculate the total number of fries:

5 large fries * 50 pieces per fry = 250 pieces of fries

Finally, we'll add all the pieces of food together:

136 slices of pizza + 54 pieces (burgers and hotdogs) + 250 pieces of fries = 440 pieces of food

Altogether, 440 pieces of food have been ordered for the party.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

17 pizzas, each with 8 slices, equal 136 pizza slices.

24 burgers + 30 hotdogs + 5 fries (with 50 pieces each) = 124 pieces of food.
136 + 124 = 260 pieces

- Burgers: 24 burgers * 1 piece per burger = 24 burger pieces
- Hotdogs: 30 hotdogs * 1 piece per hotdog = 30 hotdog pieces
- Fries: 5 large fries * 50 pieces per large fry = 250 fry pieces

Now, let's add up all the pieces:

Total pieces = 136 (pizza slices) + 24 (burger pieces) + 30 (hotdog pieces) + 250 (fry pieces)

How many students suggested adding both mashed potatoes and chicken or both bacon and vegetable stir-fry to the menu?","To find out how many students suggested adding both mashed potatoes and chicken or both bacon and vegetable stir-fry, we need to consider these as two separate groups since the question does not indicate that there are students who may have suggested more than one type of food.

First group: Students who suggested both mashed potatoes and chicken.
Second group: Students who suggested both bacon and vegetable stir-fry.

Since the question does not provide information about the overlap between the groups (i.e., students who suggested both items in each pair), we cannot simply add the numbers together. We need to consider each suggestion as a separate and unique group.

Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of students who suggested both mashed potatoes and chicken or both bacon and vegetable stir-fry without additional information about the overlap between the suggestions. The question as it stands does not provide enough information to give a precise answer.","Sofia has a tricky task of combining two foods from the student suggestions to create a delicious menu. She first needs to find out how many students want mashed potatoes and chicken, which is simply the addition of the individual suggestions: 269 + 330 = 599 students. 

Similarly, we can find that 269 students suggested bacon and vegetable stir-fry by adding the suggestions for bacon and vegetable stir-fry: 269 + 210 = 479 students.

However, we must subtract this result from the total number of students because some students may have suggested both combinations: 599 + 479 = 1,078 students. This means that there are 1,078 - 479 = 599 students who suggested adding both mashed potatoes and chicken.

Therefore, **599** students suggested combining mashed potatoes with chicken or bacon with vegetable stir-fry.","To find out how many students suggested adding both mashed potatoes and chicken or both bacon and vegetable stir-fry to the menu, we need to identify the students who suggested both of these options.

For the mashed potatoes and chicken combination:
- 330 students suggested adding mashed potatoes.
- 145 students suggested adding chicken.

For the bacon and vegetable stir-fry combination:
- 269 students suggested adding bacon.
- 210 students suggested adding vegetable stir-fry.

Now, we need to find the intersection of these two groups:
- The number of students who suggested both mashed potatoes and chicken is the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes minus the number of students who suggested chicken:
  330 (mashed potatoes) - 145 (chicken) = 185 students.

- The number of students who suggested both bacon and vegetable stir-fry is the number of students who suggested bacon minus the number of students who suggested vegetable stir-fry:
  269 (bacon) - 210 (vegetable stir-fry) = 59 students.

Finally, we need to find the number of students who suggested both combinations (mashed potatoes and chicken, and bacon and vegetable stir-fry):
- The number of students who suggested both combinations is the number of students who suggested both mashed potatoes and chicken minus the number of students who suggested both bacon and vegetable stir-fry:

So, the number of pieces in packages is:

41 (total pieces) - 6 (extra pieces) = 35 pieces in packages

Since each package contains 7 pieces, we can find the number of packages by dividing the number of pieces in packages by the number of pieces per package:

35 (pieces in packages) ÷ 7 (pieces per package) = 5 packages

So, Robin has 5 packages of gum.

Now let's find out how many packages of gum Alex has. Alex has a total of 23 pieces of gum, and he has 3 extra pieces. So, the number of pieces in packages is:

627,"Edward spent $24 to buy 5 books. The cost of each book is different. The first book costs $2 more than the second, the third book costs $4 more than the first, the fourth book costs $3 less than the third, and the fifth book costs the same as the second. Find the cost of each book.","Let's denote the cost of the second book as \( x \). According to the problem, we have:

1. The first book costs \( x + 2 \).
2. The third book costs \( (x + 2) + 4 = x + 6 \).
3. The fourth book costs \( (x + 6) - 3 = x + 3 \).
4. The fifth book costs the same as the second, so it's \( x \).

Now, we know that the total cost of the five books is $24. So we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 2) + (x + 6) + (x + 3) + x = 24 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x + 11 = 24 \]

Subtracting 11 from both sides, we get:

\[ 5x = 13 \]

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

\[ x = \frac{13}{5} \]
\[ x = 2.6 \]

Now we can find the cost of each book:

1. Second book: \( x = $2.60 \)
2. First book: \( x + 2 = $2.60 + $2.00 = $4.60 \)
3. Third book: \( x + 6 = $2.60 + $4.00 = $8.60 \)
4. Fourth book: \( x + 3 = $2.60 + $3.00 = $5.60 \)
5. Fifth book: \( x = $2.60 \)

So the cost of each book is:

1. First book: $4.60
2. Second book: $2.60
3. Third book: $8.60
4. Fourth book: $5.60
5. Fifth book: $2.60

And the total cost is indeed $24:

\[ $4.60 + $2.60 + $8.60 + $5.60 + $2.60 = $24.00 \]","1. Identify the cost of the second book: $2.

2. The first book costs $4: $4 + $2 = $6.

3. The third book costs $8: $6 + $4 = $8.

4. The fourth book costs $5: $8 - $3 = $5.

5. The fifth book also costs $2: $2 + 0 = $2.

The costs of the five books are $2, $4, $6, $5, and $2, respectively.

$19.","Let's denote the cost of the second book as \( x \).

According to the information given, the first book costs \( x + 2 \), the third book costs \( x + 4 \), the fourth book costs \( x + 3 \), and the fifth book costs \( x \).

We know that Edward spent $24 in total for 5 books, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 5 \text{ books} \times \text{cost per book} = 24 \]

Now, let's find the cost of each book:

1. The first book costs \( x + 2 \).
2. The second book costs \( x \).
3. The third book costs \( x + 4 \).
4. The fourth book costs \( x + 3 \).
5. The fifth book costs \( x \).

Now, let's plug these values into the equation:

\[ (x + 2) + x + (x + 4) + (x + 3) + x = 24 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 2 + 4 + 3 = 24 \]

\[ 5x + 9 = 24 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 5x = 24 - 9 \]
\[ 5x = 15 \]
\[ x = \frac{15}{5} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, the cost of the second book is $3. Now we can find the cost of the other books:

1. The first book costs \( x + 2 \) = \( 3 + 2 \) = $5.
2. The third book costs \( x + 4 \) = \( 3 + 4 \) = $7.
3. The fourth book costs \( x + 3 \) = \( 3 + 3 \) = $6.

Therefore, the cost of each book is:

- The first book costs $5.
- The second book costs $3.
- The third book costs $7.

For chocolate cakes:
He sold 95 and has 30 left, so he made 95 + 30 = 125 chocolate cakes initially.

For vanilla cakes:
He sold 68 and has 26 left, so he made 68 + 26 = 94 vanilla cakes initially.

For red velvet cakes:
He sold 49 and has 16 left, so he made 49 + 16 = 65 red velvet cakes initially.

So, Baker made 125 chocolate cakes, 94 vanilla cakes, and 65 red velvet cakes initially.","Baker initially made 120 chocolate cakes, 90 vanilla cakes, and 65 red velvet cakes.

The final result is 255.","To find out how many cakes of each type Baker made initially, we need to calculate the total number of cakes he sold and the total number of cakes he has left. Then, we subtract the total number of cakes he has left from the total number of cakes he sold to find the total number of cakes he made initially.

First, let's calculate the total number of cakes he sold:

Total chocolate cakes sold = 95
Total vanilla cakes sold = 68
Total red velvet cakes sold = 49

Now, let's calculate the total number of cakes he has left:

Total chocolate cakes left = 30
Total vanilla cakes left = 26
Total red velvet cakes left = 16

Next, we subtract the total number of cakes he has left from the total number of cakes he sold to find the total number of cakes he made initially:

Total chocolate cakes made initially = Total chocolate cakes sold - Total chocolate cakes left
Total chocolate cakes made initially = 95 - 30
Total chocolate cakes made initially = 65

Total vanilla cakes made initially = Total vanilla cakes sold - Total vanilla cakes left
Total vanilla cakes made initially = 68 - 26

630,"During the carnival, the ring toss game made 120 dollars in the first 20 days. However, the earnings per day increased by 2 dollars every 5 days. After the 20 days, the game made 66 dollars in the remaining 16 days, but earnings per day decreased by 1 dollar every 4 days. Calculate the earnings per day during the first day and the last day of the first 20 days at the carnival.","Let's start by calculating the earnings per day during the first day of the carnival.

We know that the ring toss game made $120 in the first 20 days. We also know that the earnings per day increased by $2 every 5 days. This means that there were 4 increments of $2 in the earnings per day over the 20 days (since 20 days / 5 days per increment = 4 increments).

Let's denote the earnings per day on the first day as E. Then, the earnings on the 5th day would be E + $2, on the 10th day E + $4, on the 15th day E + $6, and on the 20th day E + $8.

The total earnings over the 20 days would be the sum of the earnings per day for each of the 5-day periods. Since there are 4 days with the initial earnings E and 1 day with each subsequent increment, we can calculate the total earnings as follows:

Total earnings = (4 days * E) + (4 days * (E + $2)) + (4 days * (E + $4)) + (4 days * (E + $6)) + (4 days * (E + $8))

Now, we can simplify this equation:

Total earnings = 4E + 4E + 8 + 4E + 16 + 4E + 24 + 4E + 32
Total earnings = 20E + 80

We know that the total earnings for the first 20 days were $120, so we can set up the equation:

20E + 80 = 120

Now, let's solve for E:

20E = 120 - 80
20E = 40
E = 40 / 20
E = $2

So, the earnings per day during the first day were $2.

Now, let's calculate the earnings per day during the last day of the first 20 days.

We know that the earnings increased by $2 every 5 days, and by the 20th day, there were 4 increments of $2. So, the earnings on the last day of the first 20 days would be:

Earnings on the last day = E + (4 increments * $2)
Earnings on the last day = $2 + (4 * $2)
Earnings on the last day = $2 + $8
Earnings on the last day = $10

Therefore, the earnings per day during the first day were $2, and the earnings per day during the last day of the first 20 days were $10.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. The earnings increase by $2 every 5 days, so the earnings for the first day are $120. After the first 5 days, the earnings increase to $124, and so on.

2. For the first 20 days, we can calculate the average earnings per day as ($120 + 2 x 4) $128.

3. The earnings per day for the remaining 16 days decreased by $1 every 4 days. So, the earnings per day for the first of these 16 days would be the same as the last day of the first 20 days, which is $128. Decreasing by $1 every 4 days, the earnings per day for the last day of the remaining 16 days would be $125.

The answer is 128.","Let's denote the earnings per day during the first day as E1.

According to the information given, the earnings per day increased by 2 dollars every 5 days. This means that after the first day, the earnings per day would be E1 + 2 dollars.

Let's calculate the earnings per day for each of the 5-day periods:

- After the first day, earnings per day = E1 + 2 dollars
- After the second day, earnings per day = E1 + 2 + 2 dollars = E1 + 4 dollars
- After the third day, earnings per day = E1 + 4 + 2 dollars = E1 + 6 dollars
- After the fourth day, earnings per day = E1 + 6 + 2 dollars = E1 + 8 dollars
- After the fifth day, earnings per day = E1 + 8 + 2 dollars = E1 + 10 dollars

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each of the 5-day periods:

- After the first day, total earnings = E1
- After the second day, total earnings = E1 + E1 + 2 dollars = 2E1 + 2 dollars
- After the third day, total earnings = 2E1 + 2 + 2E1 + 2 dollars = 4E1 + 4 dollars
- After the fourth day, total earnings = 4E1 + 4 + 2E1 + 2 dollars = 6E1 + 6 dollars
- After the fifth day, total earnings = 6E1 + 6 + 2E1 + 2 dollars = 8E1 + 8 dollars

We know that in the first 20 days, the game made 120 dollars. Since there are 5 days in each 5-day period, we can divide the total earnings for each period by 5 to find the earnings per day for each period:

- After the first day, earnings per day = 120 / 5 = 24 dollars
- After the second day, earnings per day = (2E1 + 2) / 5 = (2E1 + 2) / 5
- After the third day, earnings per day = (4E1 + 4) / 5 = (4E1 + 4) / 5
- After the fourth day, earnings per day = (6E1 + 6) / 5 = (6E1 + 6) / 5
- After the fifth day, earnings per day = (8E1 + 8) / 5 = (8E1 + 8) / 5

Now, let's find the value of E1",128,E1,$10
631,"The Razorback shop makes $192 dollars off each t-shirt and $34 off each jersey, before a 10% discount is applied. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys. Calculate the original prices of each t-shirt and jersey, then determine how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey.","To find the original prices of each t-shirt and jersey before the 10% discount, we need to calculate the prices that would result in the shop making $192 off each t-shirt and $34 off each jersey after the discount is applied.

Let's denote the original price of a t-shirt as \( T \) and the original price of a jersey as \( J \).

After a 10% discount, the shop makes 90% of the original price, so we have:

\( 0.9T = 192 \) for t-shirts, and
\( 0.9J = 34 \) for jerseys.

To find the original prices, we divide the shop's earnings by 0.9:

\( T = \frac{192}{0.9} \) for t-shirts, and
\( J = \frac{34}{0.9} \) for jerseys.

Now, let's calculate the original prices:

\( T = \frac{192}{0.9} = \frac{192}{0.9} = 213.33 \) (rounded to two decimal places)
\( J = \frac{34}{0.9} = \frac{34}{0.9} = 37.78 \) (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the original price of a t-shirt is $213.33, and the original price of a jersey is $37.78.

To determine how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we subtract the original price of a jersey from the original price of a t-shirt:

\( T - J = 213.33 - 37.78 = 175.55 \)

Therefore, a t-shirt costs $175.55 more than a jersey before the discount is applied.","We first calculate the total revenue from the t-shirts, which is $192 * 157 = $3002. Then, we calculate the total revenue from the jerseys, which comes to $34 * 19 = $646. Before the discount, the total amount of money earned is $3002 + $646 = $3648.
The discount saves the customers $364.80, as it is 10% of $3648. Subtracting this amount from the total revenue, the Razorback shop made $3648 - $364.80 = $3283.20. This means that the original price for each t-shirt is $3283.20 / 157 = $20.85, and for each jersey $646 / 19 = $34. 

The t-shirt costs $20.85 - $34 = **$13.15** more than the jersey.","Let's denote the original price of each t-shirt as T and the original price of each jersey as J.

From the information given, we know that the Razorback shop makes $192 off each t-shirt and $34 off each jersey before the 10% discount is applied. This means that the original price of each t-shirt is $192 + $34 = $226, and the original price of each jersey is $34 + $34 = $68.

Now, let's calculate the difference in price between a t-shirt and a jersey:

T - J = $226 - $68 = $158

If Bryan has 90 novels, 160 comics, and 12 rooms in his house, how many books and magazines does he have in total?","First, let's find the values of x, y, and z based on the information given:

x is 3/4 the number of novels Bryan owns. Since he has 90 novels:
x = (3/4) * 90
x = 67.5

y is 20% more than the number of comics in his collection. Since he has 160 comics:
y = 160 + (20/100) * 160
y = 160 + 32
y = 192

z is half the number of rooms in his house. Since he has 12 rooms:
z = 1/2 * 12
z = 6

Now, we can calculate the total number of books and magazines in each bookshelf:
Books in each bookshelf = 27x
Magazines in each bookshelf = 80y

Since x = 67.5 and y = 192, we have:
Books in each bookshelf = 27 * 67.5
Magazines in each bookshelf = 80 * 192

Books in each bookshelf = 1822.5
Magazines in each bookshelf = 15360

Now, we can calculate the total number of books and magazines in all the bookshelves:
Total books = 1822.5 * 23z
Total magazines = 15360 * 23z

Since z = 6, we have:
Total books = 1822.5 * 23 * 6
Total magazines = 15360 * 23 * 6

Total books = 251,595
Total magazines = 2,119,680

Finally, we add the total number of books and magazines to get the grand total:
Grand total = Total books + Total magazines

Half the number of rooms in his house is z, so z = 12 / 2 = 6.

With 27x books in each shelf, the total number of books is 27 * 67.5 * 23z = 38887.5.

There are 80y magazines in each shelf, so the total number of magazines is 80 * 192 * 23z = 430080.

x = 3/4 * number of novels
x = 3/4 * 90
x = 67.5

Since Bryan can't have a fraction of a book, we'll round x to the nearest whole number. Since 67.5 is closer to 68 than 67, we'll round x to 68.

From the information given, we know that after selling 137 fiction books, Paul had 105 fiction books left. This means that initially, he had:

F = 105 + 137
F = 242 fiction books

We also know that Paul earned a total of $685 from selling both fiction and non-fiction books. Let's denote the number of fiction books sold as F_s and the number of non-fiction books sold as N_s. We know that F_s = 137 (since he sold 137 fiction books), and each fiction book was sold for $3. So the total money earned from selling fiction books is:

Total from fiction books = F_s * $3
Total from fiction books = 137 * $3
Total from fiction books = $411

Now, let's subtract the total money earned from fiction books from the total money earned to find out how much was earned from non-fiction books:

Total from non-fiction books = Total earned - Total from fiction books
Total from non-fiction books = $685 - $411
Total from non-fiction books = $274

Since each non-fiction book was sold for $5, we can find the number of non-fiction books sold by dividing the total money earned from non-fiction books by the price per non-fiction book:

N_s = Total from non-fiction books / $5
N_s = $274 / $5
N_s = 54.8

Since we cannot sell a fraction of a book, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Paul sold 54 non-fiction books.

Paul sold each fiction book for $3, so the total amount he earned from selling fiction books is 137 * $3 = $411.

Paul also sold non-fiction books for $5 each, but we don't know how many non-fiction books he sold. Let's denote the number of non-fiction books he sold as S.

The total amount Paul earned from selling both fiction and non-fiction books is $685. This includes the amount from selling fiction books ($411) and the amount from selling non-fiction books (S * $5). So we have the equation:

$411 + S * $5 = $685

Now, let's solve for S:

S * $5 = $685 - $411
S * $5 = $274
S = $274 / $5
S = 54.8

The first chapter is 66 pages long, the second chapter is 35 pages long, the third chapter is 24 pages long, the fourth chapter is 52 pages long, the fifth chapter is 48 pages long, the sixth chapter is 39 pages long, and the seventh chapter is 58 pages long. Calculate the total number of pages, the average page count per chapter, and the percentage of each chapter in the book.","To calculate the total number of pages, we add the page counts of all the chapters together:

Total number of pages = 66 (Chapter 1) + 35 (Chapter 2) + 24 (Chapter 3) + 52 (Chapter 4) + 48 (Chapter 5) + 39 (Chapter 6) + 58 (Chapter 7)

Total number of pages = 66 + 35 + 24 + 52 + 48 + 39 + 58
Total number of pages = 322

To calculate the average page count per chapter, we divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters:

Average page count per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
Average page count per chapter = 322 / 7
Average page count per chapter ≈ 46 pages per chapter

To calculate the percentage of each chapter in the book, we divide the page count of each chapter by the total number of pages and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

332 pages / 7 chapters = 47.43 pages per chapter

Finally, let's find the percentage of each chapter in the book:

Chapter 1: (66 / 332) x 100 = 20%

Chapter 6: (39 / 332) x 100 = 11.7%
Chapter 7: (58 / 332) x 100 = 17.5%

The chapters' contributions to the book's length are approximately 20%, 11%, 7%, 16%, 14%, 12%, and 18% respectively.

Therefore, the total length of the book is 332 pages.

Total pages = 388 pages

Now, let's calculate the average page count per chapter:

Average pages per chapter = Total pages / Number of chapters
Average pages per chapter = 388 / 7
Average pages per chapter = 55.43 pages

Since the average page count per chapter is not a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number for practical purposes. Let's round it to 55 pages per chapter.

Initial children + Children who got on - Children who got off = Total children on the bus after the stop
22 + 40 - x = 2

Now solve for x:
22 + 40 - x = 2
62 - x = 2
x = 60

So, 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop.","That's correct. The equation you've set up accurately represents the situation, and solving for x gives us the number of children who got off the bus. With 60 children getting off the bus, there are now only 2 children left on the bus after the stop.","We're looking for the number of children who got off the bus, which is represented by x. We're given the equation:

How many minutes were both machines working simultaneously?","Let's denote the number of minutes both machines were working simultaneously as \( t \).

Machine A produces 3 shirts per minute, so in \( t \) minutes, it will produce \( 3t \) shirts.
Machine B produces 5 shirts per minute, so in \( t \) minutes, it will produce \( 5t \) shirts.

Together, they produced 54 shirts, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3t + 5t = 54 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8t = 54 \]

Now, we can solve for \( t \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ t = \frac{54}{8} \]

\[ t = 6.75 \]

Therefore, both machines were working simultaneously for 6.75 minutes.","Let's solve this problem step by step:
1. First, we determine the number of shirts produced per minute by both machines working simultaneously. Machine A produces 3 shirts/minute and machine B produces 5 shirts/minute, so together they would produce 3 + 5 = 8 shirts per minute.
2. We now know that in one minute, the total production is 8 shirts. Since we have a total of 54 shirts, we can divide the total number of shirts by the production rate to find the time: 54 ÷ 8 = 6.75 minutes. 

The final result is 6.75. 

Therefore, 6.75 minutes.","Let's denote the number of minutes both machines were working simultaneously as \( x \).

In one minute, machine A can make 3 shirts, and machine B can make 5 shirts. So, in one minute, they can make \( 3 + 5 = 8 \) shirts together.

We know that they produced 54 shirts in total. To find out how many minutes they worked, we divide the total number of shirts by the number of shirts they can make in one minute:

At the end of the day, Jack had 9 emails in his inbox. We know he received 4 emails in the morning, so:

Morning emails + Afternoon emails (after deletion) = Total emails at the end of the day
4 + (A - 3) = 9

Now, let's solve for A:

A - 3 = 9 - 4
A - 3 = 5

According to the information given, Jack had 9 emails in his inbox by the end of the day. This includes the 4 emails he received in the morning and the emails he received in the afternoon before deleting any.

So, the total number of emails Jack had in his inbox before deleting any is:

\( 4 \text{ emails in the morning} + x \text{ emails in the afternoon} = 9 \text{ emails in total} \)

Now, we know that Jack deleted 3 emails that he received in the afternoon. This means that the number of emails he had in his inbox after deleting those 3 emails is:

\( 9 \text{ emails in total} - 3 \text{ emails deleted} = 6 \text{ emails in the inbox} \)

Since the 4 emails from the morning were not deleted, the 6 emails in the inbox include the 4 emails from the morning and the emails from the afternoon that were not deleted. Therefore, the number of emails from the afternoon that were not deleted is:

\( 6 \text{ emails in the inbox} - 4 \text{ emails from the morning} = 2 \text{ emails from the afternoon} \)

If 2x more birds come to join them, the total number of birds on the fence becomes x + 2x = 3x.

If 3y more storks come to join them, the total number of storks on the fence becomes y + 3y = 4y.

To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we subtract the total number of birds from the total number of storks:

We start with 3 birds and x + y storks.

When 2x birds and 3y storks arrive, the numbers become 2x + 3y storks and 5x + 6y birds.

Therefore, the answer is 9.","Let's denote the number of storks as S. According to the problem, S = y.

The problem states that 2x more birds and 3y more storks come to join them. So, the new number of birds is x + 2x = 3x, and the new number of storks is y + 3y = 4y.

Now, we need to find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence. To do this, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks:

4y - 3x

Since we don't have the values for x and y, we can't calculate the exact number of storks and birds. However, we can express the difference in terms of x and y:

4y - 3x = (4y - 3x) / (3x - 2x) = y / x

This means that for every x number of birds, there is y number of storks. So, the ratio of storks to birds is 1:1.

640,"Edward spent 40% of his money on a shirt and 25% of the remaining amount on a book. Then he decided to refund a gadget worth 1/5 of his remaining money after buying the book. After the refund, he is left with $28. How much money did Edward have initially before spending on the shirt and the book?","Let's denote Edward's initial amount of money as \( X \).

He spent 40% of his money on a shirt, so he spent \( 0.40X \) on the shirt.

The remaining amount after buying the shirt is \( X - 0.40X = 0.60X \).

Then he spent 25% of the remaining amount on a book, which is \( 0.25 \times 0.60X = 0.15X \).

The remaining amount after buying the book is \( 0.60X - 0.15X = 0.45X \).

Edward then refunded a gadget worth 1/5 of his remaining money after buying the book, which is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 0.45X = 0.09X \).

After the refund, he is left with $28, so the remaining amount after the refund is \( 0.45X - 0.09X = 0.36X \).

We can set up the equation:

\( 0.36X = 28 \)

Now, we solve for \( X \):

\( X = \frac{28}{0.36} \)

\( X = \frac{2800}{36} \)

\( X = \frac{700}{9} \)

\( X = 77.78 \)

So, Edward initially had $77.78 before spending on the shirt and the book.","Edward initially had $40.

Let's denote the amount of money Edward spent on the shirt as S. 
So 40% of S is spent on the shirt: 0.4S = unknown amount of money.

We then know that 25% of the remaining amount—which is S - 0.4S = 0.6S—is spent on the book: 0.25 * 0.6S = unknown amount of money. 

After buying the book, Edward has 0.6S - unknown amount of money left. We now know that this remaining amount—let's call it R—is equal to 1/5 of R, which is the refund Edward made: 0.2R = R - unknown amount of money. 

Solving this equation tells us that the unknown amount of money spent on the book is $7, and therefore R is $14. 

As we know that after the refund Edward has $28 left, Edward's initial amount of money before spending on the shirt and book was $28 + $14 = **$42**.","Let's denote the initial amount of money Edward had as \( M \).

Edward spent 40% of his money on a shirt, so he spent \( 0.40M \) on the shirt.

After spending on the shirt, he had \( M - 0.40M = 0.60M \) left.

He then spent 25% of the remaining amount on a book, so he spent \( 0.25 \times 0.60M = 0.15M \) on the book.

After spending on the book, he had \( 0.60M - 0.15M = 0.45M \) left.

He then refunded a gadget worth 1/5 of his remaining money, so he refunded \( \frac{1}{5} \times 0.45M = 0.09M \).

After the refund, he was left with \( 0.45M - 0.09M = 0.36M \), which is $28.

To find the initial amount of money \( M \), we set up the equation:

\( 0.36M = 28 \)

Now, we solve for \( M \):

\( M = \frac{28}{0.36} \)

\( M = \frac{28}{0.36} \times \frac{1}{1} \)

\( M = \frac{28}{0.36} \)

\( M = 78.88888888888889 \)

Since we can't have a fraction of a dollar, we'll round to the nearest cent:

She bought a total of 12 small water bottles (500mL each) and 16 big water bottles (1L each). Considering that Debby consumes 3L of water daily, how many days would her water supply last before she needs to buy more? (Assume a week starts on Monday.)","First, let's calculate the total volume of water Debby bought:

12 small bottles at 500mL each = 12 * 500mL = 6000mL
16 big bottles at 1L each = 16 * 1000mL = 16000mL

Total volume of water = 6000mL + 16000mL = 22000mL
Since 1L = 1000mL, the total volume in liters is 22000mL / 1000 = 22L

Now, let's calculate her daily water consumption:

On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she drinks 6 bottles a day. Since we don't know the size of the bottles she drinks daily, we'll assume she consumes 3L a day as given in the problem. So for 5 weekdays, she consumes:
5 days * 3L/day = 15L

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), she drinks 8 bottles a day. Again, we'll assume she consumes 3L a day. So for 2 weekend days, she consumes:
2 days * 3L/day = 6L

Total weekly consumption = 15L (weekdays) + 6L (weekends) = 21L

Now, let's see how many weeks her water supply would last:

Total water supply is 22L, and she consumes 21L per week, so after one week, she would have:
22L - 21L = 1L left

Since she consumes 3L per day, the remaining 1L would not be enough for another full day. Therefore, her water supply would last for 1 week plus part of a day before she needs to buy more.","Debby's weekly water consumption is 21 liters, calculated as follows:
6 bottles (0.5L) x 2 (weekday multiplication factor) x 5 days (Monday to Friday) = 6 x 2 x 5 = 60 L
8 bottles (0.5L) x 2 (weekend multiplication factor) x 2 days (Saturday and Sunday) = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 L
60L + 32L = 92L / 3L per day = 30.67 days 

**31 days**","First, let's calculate the total volume of water Debby consumes in a week.

On weekdays, she consumes 6 bottles of water a day, which is 6 * 500mL = 3000mL.
On weekends, she consumes 8 bottles of water a day, which is 8 * 500mL = 4000mL.

Now, let's calculate the total volume of water she consumes in a week:

Weekday volume = 3000mL * 5 = 15000mL
Weekend volume = 4000mL * 2 = 8000mL

Total weekly volume = 15000mL + 8000mL = 23000mL

Now, let's convert the total weekly volume to liters:

Total weekly volume in liters = 23000mL / 1000mL/L = 23L

Debby consumes 3L of water daily, so we need to find out how many days her weekly volume will last:

Days = Total weekly volume in liters / Daily consumption in liters
Days = 23L / 3L/day
Days = 7.666666666666667

How many more sweet cookies than salty cookies did he eat?","Paco ate cookies in the ratio of 3:1:2 for Sweet:Salty:Chocolate. This means that for every 3 sweet cookies he ate, he ate 1 salty cookie and 2 chocolate cookies.

First, let's find the total number of parts in the ratio:
3 (Sweet) + 1 (Salty) + 2 (Chocolate) = 6 parts

Now, let's find out how many times the entire ratio fits into the total number of cookies he ate:
27 (Sweet) + 6 (Salty) + 8 (Chocolate) = 41 cookies

The ratio represents 6 parts, and he ate a total of 41 cookies. However, the number of cookies he ate does not fit the ratio perfectly because 41 is not a multiple of 6. Therefore, we need to check if the cookies he ate actually follow the ratio given.

According to the ratio, for every 3 sweet cookies, there should be 1 salty cookie and 2 chocolate cookies. If we divide the number of sweet cookies he ate (27) by 3, we get 9. This means he should have eaten 9 salty cookies (3 times the number of salty cookies) and 18 chocolate cookies (9 times 2) to maintain the ratio. However, he only ate 6 salty cookies and 8 chocolate cookies, which does not follow the 3:1:2 ratio.

Since the ratio was not followed, we will simply calculate the difference between the number of sweet and salty cookies he ate:

He ate 27 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies.

The difference is:
27 (Sweet) - 6 (Salty) = 21 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.","Paco ate three times as many sweet cookies as salty cookies, so we need to divide the number of salty cookies eaten by three.

8 chocolate cookies + 6 salty cookies = 14 cookies

The ratio of sweet to salty cookies Paco ate is 3:1. To find out how many more sweet cookies than salty cookies he ate, we need to compare the number of sweet cookies to the number of salty cookies in the ratio.

First, let's find the total number of cookies Paco ate:
Total cookies = Sweet cookies + Salty cookies + Chocolate cookies
Total cookies = 27 + 6 + 8
Total cookies = 41

Now, let's find the ratio of sweet to salty cookies Paco ate:
Sweet to salty ratio = 3:1

To find out how many more sweet cookies than salty cookies Paco ate, we need to compare the number of sweet cookies to the number of salty cookies in the ratio. Since the ratio is 3:1, we can say that for every 1 salty cookie, Paco ate 3 sweet cookies.

Now, let's calculate the number of sweet cookies Paco ate for every 1 salty cookie:
Sweet cookies per salty cookie = 3

Since Paco ate 6 salty cookies, we can multiply the number of sweet cookies per salty cookie by the number of salty cookies to find out how many sweet cookies he ate:
Sweet cookies = Sweet cookies per salty cookie * Salty cookies
Sweet cookies = 3 * 6
Sweet cookies = 18

For the group of 266 pickers:
They fill 90 drums in 5 days, so their daily rate is 90 drums / 5 days = 18 drums per day.

For the group of 134 pickers:
They fill 70 drums in 4 days, so their daily rate is 70 drums / 4 days = 17.5 drums per day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of drums filled by all 400 pickers in one day by adding the daily rates of both groups.

Total drums per day = 18 drums/day (by 266 pickers) + 17.5 drums/day (by 134 pickers)
Total drums per day = 18 + 17.5
Total drums per day = 35.5

Therefore, all 400 grape pickers would fill 35.5 drums of grapes in each day.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. The average number of drums filled per day by the average pickers is 90 drums / 5 days = 18 drums per day.

2. Similarly, the rate of work for the faster pickers is 70 drums / 4 days = 17.5 drums per day.

3. When working together, the total amount of work done per day is: 18 drums/day * 266 pickers + 17.5 drums/day * 134 pickers = 541.5 drums per day.

Therefore the final result is 541.5.","First, let's find out how many drums of grapes the 266 pickers with average ability can fill in one day. Since they fill 90 drums in 5 days, we divide the number of drums by the number of days to get the daily production:

Now, let's find out how many drums of grapes the 134 pickers with higher ability can fill in one day. Since they fill 70 drums in 4 days, we divide the number of drums by the number of days to get the daily production:

70 drums / 4 days = 17.5 drums per day

Since we can't have a fraction of a drum, we'll assume that the 134 pickers can fill 17 drums per day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of drums that can be filled by all 400 pickers in one day. We do this by adding the daily production of the 266 pickers to the daily production of the 134 pickers:

18 drums per day (average ability) + 17 drums per day (higher ability) = 35 drums per day

So, all 400 pickers can fill 35 drums of grapes in one day.",541.5,35,35.5

650,"Zachary is preparing to create a large sculpture using feathers and wax. At the beginning, he has 33 g of wax and needs to cover three sets of feathers. Each set of feathers requires the following amount of wax:

- Set A: 492 g
- Set B: 344 g
- Set C: 217 g

In order to cover all three sets of feathers, Zachary decides to collect three different types of wax: yellow, blue, and green. He currently has:

- 11 g of yellow wax
- 10 g of blue wax
- 12 g of green wax

How many more grams of each type of wax does Zachary need to collect to have enough wax to cover all three sets of feathers?","First, let's calculate the total amount of wax Zachary needs to cover all three sets of feathers:

Set A: 492 g
Set B: 344 g
Set C: 217 g

Total wax needed = 492 g + 344 g + 217 g = 1053 g

Now, let's calculate the total amount of wax Zachary currently has:

Yellow wax: 11 g
Blue wax: 10 g
Green wax: 12 g

Total current wax = 11 g + 10 g + 12 g = 33 g

To find out how much more wax Zachary needs, we subtract the total current wax from the total wax needed:

Wax needed = Total wax needed - Total current wax
Wax needed = 1053 g - 33 g = 1020 g

Zachary needs 1020 more grams of wax to cover all three sets of feathers.

Since Zachary is collecting three different types of wax, we can assume he wants to collect them in equal amounts to make up the 1020 g needed. To find out how much more of each type of wax he needs, we divide the total additional wax needed by 3:

Additional wax needed for each type = Wax needed / 3
Additional wax needed for each type = 1020 g / 3 = 340 g

Now, we subtract the amount of each type of wax he already has from the additional wax needed for each type:

Additional yellow wax needed = 340 g - 11 g = 329 g
Additional blue wax needed = 340 g - 10 g = 330 g
Additional green wax needed = 340 g - 12 g = 328 g

Zachary needs to collect 329 g more of yellow wax, 330 g more of blue wax, and 328 g more of green wax.","Zachary needs to collect more:

- 481 g for Set A
- 334 g for Set B
- 205 g for Set C

So in total, he requires 1020 g of wax.

**1020 g**","To find out how many more grams of each type of wax Zachary needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of wax needed for all three sets of feathers.

Total wax needed = Wax for Set A + Wax for Set B + Wax for Set C
Total wax needed = 492 g + 344 g + 217 g
Total wax needed = 1053 g

Now, let's calculate the total amount of wax Zachary currently has:

Current wax = Wax for yellow + Wax for blue + Wax for green
Current wax = 11 g + 10 g + 12 g
Current wax = 33 g

To find out how much more wax Zachary needs, we subtract the current wax from the total wax needed:

More wax needed = Total wax needed - Current wax

Now, let's distribute this amount of wax needed among the three types of wax:

More wax for yellow = More wax needed / 3
More wax for blue = More wax needed / 3
More wax for green = More wax needed / 3

More wax for yellow = 1020 g / 3
More wax for yellow = 340 g

More wax for blue = 1020 g / 3
More wax for blue = 340 g

More wax for green = 1020 g / 3

If the mailman has to give 23 pieces of junk mail to each block, how many houses are there in a block?","If the mailman gives 3 pieces of junk mail to each house and needs to give out a total of 23 pieces of junk mail to the entire block, we can divide the total number of junk mails by the number of junk mails given to each house to find the number of houses in the block.

Number of houses in the block = Total junk mails / Junk mails per house
Number of houses in the block = 23 / 3

Since 3 does not divide evenly into 23, we will have a remainder. To find the whole number of houses, we divide 23 by 3 and ignore the remainder.

23 divided by 3 is 7 with a remainder of 2.

So, there are 7 full houses that receive 3 pieces of junk mail each. The remaining 2 pieces of junk mail cannot be evenly distributed if each house must receive 3 pieces. Therefore, the mailman cannot fully service another house with the remaining junk mail, and we can conclude that there are 7 houses in the block.","We're given that the mailman gives 3 junk mails to each house and that this equates to 23 pieces of junk mail for the entire block.

3 x number of houses = 23
So, the number of houses is 23 / 3, which equals 7.6666... houses.

number of houses = 23 / 3
number of houses = 7.666666666666666

Additionally, his weekly expenses include $216 for rent, $75 for groceries, $45 for utilities, and an unreliable $10 to $50 for miscellaneous expenses. How much money will Lewis have saved up at the end of the harvest season, taking into account these varying income and expenses?","To calculate the total savings Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to consider the minimum and maximum possible savings each week and then multiply those by the number of weeks in the harvest season.

First, let's calculate the minimum weekly savings:

Minimum weekly income: $491
Weekly expenses:
- Rent: $216
- Groceries: $75
- Utilities: $45
- Miscellaneous (minimum): $10

Total minimum weekly expenses: $216 + $75 + $45 + $10 = $346

Minimum weekly savings: $491 - $346 = $145

Now, let's calculate the maximum weekly savings:

Maximum weekly income: $621
Weekly expenses:
- Rent: $216
- Groceries: $75
- Utilities: $45
- Miscellaneous (maximum): $50

Total maximum weekly expenses: $216 + $75 + $45 + $50 = $386

Maximum weekly savings: $621 - $386 = $235

Now we can calculate the total savings over the 1181 weeks of harvest:

Minimum total savings: $145 * 1181 weeks = $171,245
Maximum total savings: $235 * 1181 weeks = $277,535

Therefore, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have saved up between $171,245 and $277,535, depending on his weekly income and expenses.","Lewis's weekly income falls between $491 and $621. We'll calculate the midpoint of this range for simplicity, which is $556. 

His weekly expenses include: 
- $216 for rent.
- $75 for groceries. 
- $45 for utilities. 
- A variable $30 for miscellaneous (taking the midpoint of the $10 to $50 range). 

That gives a weekly expense total of $366. 

Multiplying the weekly savings by the number of weeks of the harvest season, Lewis will have saved between $556 x 1181 weeks - $366 x 1181 weeks = $656,396 - $428,996 = **$227,400**. 

The final result is two hundred and twenty-seven thousand four hundred dollars.","First, let's calculate the total amount of money Lewis earns over the 1181 weeks of harvest. Since his earnings vary between $491 and $621 per week, we'll use the average of these two amounts to get a reasonable estimate.

Average earnings per week = ($491 + $621) / 2 = $556

Now, let's calculate the total earnings over the 1181 weeks:

Total earnings = Average earnings per week * Number of weeks
Total earnings = $556 * 1181
Total earnings = $652,016

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Lewis spends on expenses each week:

Rent = $216
Groceries = $75
Utilities = $45
Miscellaneous = $10 to $50 (we'll use the average of these two amounts)
Miscellaneous = ($10 + $50) / 2 = $30

Now, let's calculate the total expenses over the 1181 weeks:

Total expenses = (Rent + Groceries + Utilities + Miscellaneous) * Number of weeks
Total expenses = ($216 + $75 + $45 + $30) * 1181
Total expenses = ($376 + $30) * 1181
Total expenses = $406 * 1181
Total expenses = $478,166

Finally, let's calculate the amount of money Lewis will have saved up at the end of the harvest season:

Amount saved = Total earnings - Total expenses
Amount saved = $652,016 - $478,166
Amount saved = $173,850

If they collect the same number of both sack types daily, how many oranges do they harvest per day?","Let's calculate the number of oranges collected each day for both types of sacks.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, they collect Type A sacks:
76 sacks/day * 50 oranges/sack = 3800 oranges/day

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, they collect Type B sacks:
56 sacks/day * 75 oranges/sack = 4200 oranges/day

Since they discard 64 sacks every day, we need to know how many oranges are in the discarded sacks. However, we are told that they collect the same number of both sack types daily. This means that the discarded sacks must be a mix of Type A and Type B sacks that equals the same number of oranges collected daily.

Let's assume that the discarded sacks are all of one type to find out how many oranges are discarded daily. If they were all Type A sacks:
64 sacks/day * 50 oranges/sack = 3200 oranges/day

If they were all Type B sacks:
64 sacks/day * 75 oranges/sack = 4800 oranges/day

Since the number of oranges discarded must be the same as the number of oranges collected daily, and the number of oranges collected daily is between 3200 and 4800, we can conclude that the number of oranges discarded daily is either 3800 or 4200, matching the number of oranges collected daily for Type A and Type B sacks, respectively.

Therefore, the number of oranges harvested per day is either 3800 or 4200, depending on the day of the week.","Here are the steps to solve the math problem:

1. First, find the number of oranges in Type A sacks collected on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: 50 oranges/sack × 76 sacks = 3,800 oranges.

2. Next, find the number of oranges in Type B sacks collected on Tuesdays and Thursdays: 75 oranges/sack × 56 sacks = 4,200 oranges.

3. Now, add the oranges collected from both types of sacks on each day: 3,800 oranges + 4,200 oranges = 8,000 oranges.

4. Finally, subtract the number of oranges lost due to the discarded sacks: 8,000 oranges - 64 sacks × 50 oranges = 7,600 oranges.

Since they discard 64 sacks every day, we need to subtract this from the total number of sacks they collect on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
8000 oranges (from Type A and B) - 64 sacks * 50 oranges/sack = 8000 oranges - 3200 oranges = 4800 oranges

Now, let's find out the total number of oranges they collect on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
4200 oranges (from Type B) - 64 sacks * 75 oranges/sack = 4200 oranges - 4800 oranges = 0 oranges

Since they collect 0 oranges on Tuesdays and Thursdays, we need to add the oranges they collect on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to the oranges they collect on Tuesdays and Thursdays to get the total number of oranges they harvest per day:
4800 oranges (from Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) + 0 oranges (from Tuesdays and Thursdays) = 4800 oranges

Therefore, they harvest 4800 oranges per day.","7,600",4800,3800 or 4200

How many more peaches does Amanda have than the average number of peaches Jake, Steven, and Jill have?","First, let's find out how many peaches each person has:

Jill has 12 peaches.
Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill, so Steven has 12 + 15 = 27 peaches.
Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 27 - 16 = 11 peaches.
Amanda has twice as many peaches as Jill, so Amanda has 12 * 2 = 24 peaches.

Now, let's find the average number of peaches Jake, Steven, and Jill have:

The total number of peaches Jake, Steven, and Jill have is 11 + 27 + 12 = 50 peaches.
The average number of peaches is 50 peaches / 3 people = 16.67 peaches (rounded to two decimal places).

Finally, let's find out how many more peaches Amanda has than the average:

Amanda has 24 peaches, and the average is 16.67 peaches, so Amanda has 24 - 16.67 = 7.33 more peaches than the average.","Let's solve this problem step by step:
1. Starting with Jill's 12 peaches, Steven has 15 more, so he has 12 + 15 = 27 peaches.
2. Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 27 - 16 = 11 peaches.
3. Amanda has twice as many peaches as Jill, so she has 2 x 12 = 24 peaches.
4. The total number of peaches Jake, Steven, and Jill have is 11 + 27 + 12 = 40 peaches.
5. As Amanda has 24 peaches, she has 24 - 40 / 3 = 8 more peaches than the average number of peaches the other three have. 

The final result is 8.","First, let's find out how many peaches Steven has. Since Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill, and Jill has 12 peaches, Steven has:
12 + 15 = 27 peaches.

Now, let's find out how many peaches Jake has. Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has:
27 - 16 = 11 peaches.

Next, let's find out how many peaches Amanda has. Amanda has twice as many peaches as Jill, so Amanda has:
12 * 2 = 24 peaches.

Now, let's find the average number of peaches Jake, Steven, and Jill have. The total number of peaches they have is:
Jake's peaches + Steven's peaches + Jill's peaches = 11 + 27 + 12 = 50 peaches.

The average number of peaches is:

Let B be the size of each banana group, O be the size of each orange group, and A be the size of each apple group.

Given the information above, solve the system of linear equations to determine the size of each group of fruits (B, O, and A):

1) 47B = 142
2) 178O = 356
3) 35A = 245","To solve for B, O, and A, we will divide the total number of each fruit by the number of groups they are organized into.

For bananas:
1) 47B = 142
To find B, we divide both sides of the equation by 47:
B = 142 / 47
B = 3

For oranges:
2) 178O = 356
To find O, we divide both sides of the equation by 178:
O = 356 / 178
O = 2

For apples:

B = 3 bananas per group
O = 2 oranges per group
A = 7 apples per group","Here are the steps to solve the system of linear equations:

1. We divide Equation 1 by 47 and Equation 2 by 178. This simplifies to:

   - B = 3

2. We multiply Equation 3 by 35 to get:

   35A = 245

3. Dividing both sides by 35, we get:

If they are traveling at a speed of 12.5 feet per minute, how much farther and how long will it take to reach the end of the cave?","To find out how much farther they have to travel to reach the end of the cave, we subtract the distance they have already covered from the total depth of the cave:

Total depth of the cave = 3256 feet
Distance already covered = 2157 feet

Distance remaining = Total depth of the cave - Distance already covered
Distance remaining = 3256 feet - 2157 feet
Distance remaining = 1099 feet

Now, to find out how long it will take to cover the remaining distance at a speed of 12.5 feet per minute, we divide the remaining distance by the speed:

Time = Distance remaining / Speed
Time = 1099 feet / 12.5 feet per minute
Time = 87.92 minutes

Since we usually express time in whole minutes, we can round this to the nearest minute:

Time ≈ 88 minutes

The first type of wax is available in 2.5 kg quantities, the second type of wax is available in 1.75 lb, and the third type of wax is available in 30 oz. 

Arthur needs to find out how many grams of each type of wax he requires to fulfill his current project requirements. To do this, he first needs to convert all the available wax quantities to grams (1 kg = 1000 g, 1 lb = 453.592 g, 1 oz = 28.3495 g).

Once he has converted the wax quantities into grams, he finds that he needs 8% of the first type of wax, 15% of the second type of wax, and 20% of the third type of wax for his project. 

Calculate the total amount of wax Arthur requires in grams for his project, combining all three types of wax.","First, let's convert all the available wax quantities to grams.

For the first type of wax:
2.5 kg = 2.5 * 1000 g = 2500 g

For the second type of wax:
1.75 lb = 1.75 * 453.592 g = 793.786 g

For the third type of wax:
30 oz = 30 * 28.3495 g = 850.485 g

Now, let's calculate the amount of each type of wax Arthur needs for his project:

For the first type of wax:
8% of 2500 g = 0.08 * 2500 g = 200 g

For the second type of wax:
15% of 793.786 g = 0.15 * 793.786 g = 119.068 g

For the third type of wax:
20% of 850.485 g = 0.20 * 850.485 g = 170.097 g

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of wax required by adding the amounts of all three types:

Total wax required = 200 g + 119.068 g + 170.097 g = 489.165 g

Arthur requires a total of 489.165 grams of wax for his project.","1. We first need to convert the given weights of the three types of wax into grams:
   - 2.5 kg = 2500 grams
   - 1.75 lbs = 790.788 grams
   - 30 oz = 853.988 grams

2. Next, we'll calculate the required amount of each wax type in grams using the given percentages:
   - Type 1: 2500 grams * 8% = 200 grams
   - Type 2: 790.788 grams * 15% = 118.618 grams
   - Type 3: 853.988 grams * 20% = 170.798 grams

3. Now, we'll add up the required amounts to find the total needed for Arthur's project:

So, **489.42** grams of wax are required for Arthur's decorative piece.","First, let's convert the available wax quantities to grams:

1. The first type of wax is available in 2.5 kg, so we convert it to grams:
   2.5 kg * 1000 g/kg = 2500 g

2. The second type of wax is available in 1.75 lb, so we convert it to grams:
   1.75 lb * 453.592 g/lb = 800.086 g

3. The third type of wax is available in 30 oz, so we convert it to grams:
   30 oz * 28.3495 g/oz = 850.485 g

Now, let's calculate the required amount of each type of wax in grams:

1. For the first type of wax, Arthur needs 8% of it:
   8% of 2500 g = 0.08 * 2500 g = 200 g

2. For the second type of wax, Arthur needs 15% of it:

661,"Olivia had 106 dollars in her wallet. After visiting a supermarket and a showroom, she had 26 dollars left. Olivia spent 49 dollars at the showroom, but she also received a 10% discount on her purchase. Additionally, she bought items at the supermarket that had a 7% sales tax applied. How much did she spend at the supermarket before the sales tax was added?","Let's start by calculating how much Olivia spent in total after visiting both the supermarket and the showroom. She had $106 initially and was left with $26, so the total amount spent is:

$106 - $26 = $80

Now, we know that Olivia spent $49 at the showroom, but she also received a 10% discount on her purchase. Let's find out the original price of the items before the discount was applied. Let the original price be \( P \).

The discount amount is 10% of \( P \), which is \( 0.10P \). After the discount, Olivia paid $49, so we can write the equation:

\( P - 0.10P = $49 \)

Combining like terms, we get:

\( 0.90P = $49 \)

Now, we solve for \( P \):

\( P = $49 / 0.90 \)

\( P = $54.44 \) (rounded to two decimal places)

This means the original price of the items at the showroom before the discount was $54.44.

Now, let's find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket. We know the total amount spent was $80, and we've just calculated that the amount spent at the showroom before the discount was $54.44. So, the amount spent at the supermarket including the sales tax is:

$80 - $54.44 = $25.56

Let's call the amount Olivia spent at the supermarket before the sales tax \( S \). The sales tax is 7%, so the total amount spent at the supermarket including the sales tax is \( S + 0.07S \).

We can write the equation:

\( S + 0.07S = $25.56 \)

Combining like terms, we get:

\( 1.07S = $25.56 \)

Now, we solve for \( S \):

\( S = $25.56 / 1.07 \)

\( S = $23.89 \) (rounded to two decimal places)

So, Olivia spent $23.89 at the supermarket before the sales tax was added.","Olivia spent $80 at the supermarket. 

This problem can be solved in multiple steps. First, we find out how much Olivia spent at the showroom: 49 dollars + 10% = 53.90. We know that she started with $106, so we subtract the showroom expense from that: $106 - $53.90 = $52.10. 

Now we know that after the supermarket visit, Olivia had $26 left, which means she spent $52.10 - $26 = $26.10 at the supermarket. Before the 7% sales tax was added, this amount would have been $24.51.

Supermarket expense: $24.51

(Please note that the calculation assumes that the discount and sales tax were applied consecutively, which may not have been the case in reality.)","Let's denote the amount Olivia spent at the supermarket before the sales tax as \( S \).

We know that Olivia had 106 dollars in her wallet initially. After visiting the supermarket and the showroom, she had 26 dollars left. This means she spent a total of \( 106 - 26 = 80 \) dollars.

We are told that Olivia spent 49 dollars at the showroom and received a 10% discount on her purchase. The discount amount would be \( 10\% \times 49 = 4.90 \) dollars, but since discounts are usually rounded to the nearest cent, we'll assume it's \( 4.90 \) dollars.

So, the amount Olivia spent at the showroom after the discount is \( 49 - 4.90 = 44.10 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much she spent at the supermarket. We know that she spent a total of 80 dollars, and 44.10 dollars of that was at the showroom. Therefore, the amount she spent at the supermarket is \( 80 - 44.10 = 35.90 \) dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much she spent at the supermarket before the sales tax was added. We know that the sales tax was 7% of the amount spent at the supermarket. So, the sales tax amount is \( 7\% \times 35.90 = 2.513 \) dollars.

To find out how much she spent at the supermarket before the sales tax was added, we subtract the sales tax amount from the total amount she spent at the supermarket: \( 35.90 - 2.513 = 33.387 \) dollars.

Since we usually round to the nearest cent, we'll round the amount to 33.39 dollars.",24.51,33.39,$23.89

310 (Day 1) + 295 (Day 2) + 317 (Day 3) + 325 (Day 4) + 298 (Day 5) = 1545 visitors

To find the daily average of visitors, we divide the total number of visitors by the number of days:

1545 visitors / 5 days = 309 visitors per day (on average)

To find the difference in the number of visitors between the days with the highest and lowest visitor counts, we identify the highest and lowest counts and subtract the lowest from the highest:

Highest visitor count: 325 (Day 4)
Lowest visitor count: 295 (Day 2)

Difference: 325 - 295 = 30 visitors

So, the total number of visitors over five days is 1545, the daily average is 309 visitors, and the difference between the highest and lowest visitor counts is 30 visitors.","We will go through the following steps to solve the math problem:

1. Calculate the total number of visitors over five days by summing up the daily counts:
Total Visitors = Day 1 + Day 2 + Day 3 + Day 4 + Day 5
Total Visitors = 310 + 295 + 317 + 325 + 298 = 1,540

Highest Count: Day 4 (325 visitors)
Lowest Count: Day 2 (295 visitors)

4. Find the difference in visitor counts between the highest and lowest days:
Difference = Highest Count - Lowest Count
Difference = 325 - 295 = 30

The total number of visitors over the five days is 1,540.

The daily average of visitor attendance is 308.

The difference in visitor counts between the highest and lowest days is 30.","The total number of visitors over five days is the sum of the visitor counts for each day:

Total visitors = 310 (Day 1) + 295 (Day 2) + 317 (Day 3) + 325 (Day 4) + 298 (Day 5)
Total visitors = 1545

To find the daily average of visitors, we divide the total number of visitors by the number of days:

Daily average = Total visitors / Number of days
Daily average = 1545 / 5
Daily average = 309

The difference in the number of visitors between the days with the highest and lowest visitor counts is:

Difference = Visitor count of highest day - Visitor count of lowest day
Difference = 325 (Day 4) - 295 (Day 2)
Difference = 30

So, the total number of visitors over five days is 1545, the daily average of visitors is 309, and the difference in the number of visitors between the days with the highest and lowest visitor counts is 30.",30,30,30

Zachary's total exercises = Push-ups + Crunches + Jumping jacks
Zachary's total exercises = 59 + 44 + 36
Zachary's total exercises = 139

Now let's calculate the number of exercises David did:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 19
David's push-ups = 59 + 19
David's push-ups = 78

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 27
David's crunches = 44 - 27
David's crunches = 17

David's jumping jacks = Zachary's jumping jacks + 8
David's jumping jacks = 36 + 8
David's jumping jacks = 44

Now let's calculate the total number of exercises David did:

David's total exercises = Push-ups + Crunches + Jumping jacks
David's total exercises = 78 + 17 + 44
David's total exercises = 139

So, Zachary did 139 exercises and David also did 139 exercises.","Let's analyze the information given:
Zachary did: 59 push-ups + 44 crunches + 36 jumping jacks = 149 exercises
David did 59 push-ups (the same as Zachary) + 17 crunches (27 less than Zachary) + 44 jumping jacks (8 more than Zachary) = 120 exercises
Now, we add Zachary and David's exercises together: 149 + 120 = 269 exercises

Therefore, they did 269 exercises in total.

Peace.","Zachary did 59 push-ups, 44 crunches, and 36 jumping jacks, so his total number of exercises is:

59 (push-ups) + 44 (crunches) + 36 (jumping jacks) = 149 exercises

David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did:

59 (Zachary's push-ups) + 19 (more push-ups) = 78 push-ups

David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so he did:

44 (Zachary's crunches) - 27 (less crunches) = 17 crunches

David did 8 more jumping jacks than Zachary, so he did:

36 (Zachary's jumping jacks) + 8 (more jumping jacks) = 44 jumping jacks

So, David's total number of exercises is:

78 (push-ups) + 17 (crunches) + 44 (jumping jacks) = 149 exercises

Both Zachary and David did the same total number of exercises, which is 149 each.",269,149,139
665,"Initially, there were 2 birds and 6 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds and 4 more storks came to join them. Later, 2 storks and 1 bird flew away, while 5 ducks also joined them on the fence. How many more storks than birds are now sitting on the fence?","Let's calculate the number of birds and storks on the fence step by step:

Initial number of birds: 2
Initial number of storks: 6

3 more birds joined, so:
New number of birds = 2 (initial) + 3 (joined) = 5 birds

4 more storks joined, so:
New number of storks = 6 (initial) + 4 (joined) = 10 storks

Then, 2 storks and 1 bird flew away:
Number of birds after 1 flew away = 5 (current) - 1 (flew away) = 4 birds
Number of storks after 2 flew away = 10 (current) - 2 (flew away) = 8 storks

5 ducks also joined, but since we are only comparing the number of storks to birds, we don't need to consider the ducks in this calculation.

Now, let's find out how many more storks than birds are on the fence:
Number of storks - Number of birds = 8 storks - 4 birds = 4 more storks than birds.","There were initially 2 birds and 6 storks, giving us 6 - 2 = 4 more storks than birds.

When the new birds and storks arrived, the numbers became 5 birds and 10 storks, which is still 10 - 5 = 5 more storks.

After some left, the remaining group consisted of 3 birds and 8 storks, giving us 8 - 3 = 5 more storks than birds. 

With the ducks joining, the final count became 8 birds (3 birds + 5 ducks) and 8 storks, an equal number of each.

So the result is 0. 




0.","Initially, there were 2 birds and 6 storks on the fence. Then, 3 more birds and 4 more storks came to join them, making it 2 + 3 = 5 birds and 6 + 4 = 10 storks.

Later, 2 storks and 1 bird flew away, so there were 10 - 2 = 8 storks and 5 - 1 = 4 birds left.

Then, 5 ducks also joined them on the fence, making it 4 + 5 = 9 birds and 8 + 5 = 13 storks.

Now, there are 13 storks and 9 birds on the fence. To find out how many more storks than birds there are, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks:

13 storks - 9 birds = 4 more storks than birds.",0,4,4
666,"During summer break, in Lawrence county, 65% of the kids stayed at home and the rest went to camp. In the neighboring Jostens county, only 45% of the kids stayed home while the rest went to camp. Additionally, 78 kids from outside these two counties attended the camp in Lawrence county while 52 kids from outside attended the camp in Jostens county. Given that the total number of kids who went to both camps was 1155612, how many kids are there in each of Lawrence and Jostens counties?","Let's denote the total number of kids in Lawrence county as L and the total number of kids in Jostens county as J.

From the information given, we know that 65% of kids in Lawrence county stayed at home, which means that 35% went to camp. Similarly, in Jostens county, 45% stayed at home, so 55% went to camp.

The number of kids from Lawrence county who went to camp is 0.35L, and the number of kids from Jostens county who went to camp is 0.55J.

We also know that 78 kids from outside these two counties attended the camp in Lawrence county and 52 kids from outside attended the camp in Jostens county.

The total number of kids who went to both camps is given as 1155612. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

0.35L + 78 + 0.55J + 52 = 1155612

Now, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms:

0.35L + 0.55J = 1155612 - 78 - 52
0.35L + 0.55J = 1155482

We have one equation with two unknowns, which means we need another equation to solve for L and J. However, we are not given any other direct information to create a second equation.

Without additional information, such as the total number of kids in one of the counties or the ratio of kids between the two counties, we cannot determine the exact number of kids in each county. We would need more data to solve this problem.","We are asked to find the number of kids in Lawrence and Jostens counties during the summer break while knowing the attendance figures for their camps.

We know that:
65% of the kids in Lawrence county stayed at home. Therefore, 35% (= 100% - 65%) went to camp.
In Jostens county, 45% of the kids stayed home, which means 55% went to camp.
1155612 kids in total attended both camps.

We also know that the number of kids attending each camp is equal to the total number of kids in the county it represents, minus the kids who stayed home.

For Lawrence county camp:
35% of the kids went to the camp, so we will assume this percentage applies to the total number of kids in the county. 35% of x = 78 + unknown number of kids in Lawrence county. 

For Jostens county:
55% of the kids went to their camp. This percentage applied to the total number of kids in Jostens county gives us: 55% of y = 52 + unknown number of kids in Jostens county. 

We now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, x and y, the number of kids in Lawrence and Jostens counties, which we can solve simultaneously:

0.35x + 0.65x = 78 + x
0.55y + 0.45y = 52 + y

Solving this system gives us the values: x = 110880 and y = 146400.

Therefore, the number of kids in Lawrence county is 110880 and in Jostens county is 146400.

Kids: 110880 and 146400.","Let's denote the total number of kids in Lawrence county as L and the total number of kids in Jostens county as J.

According to the information given, 65% of the kids in Lawrence county stayed home, so the remaining 35% went to camp. Similarly, 45% of the kids in Jostens county stayed home, so the remaining 55% went to camp.

We are also told that 78 kids from outside these two counties attended the camp in Lawrence county, and 52 kids from outside attended the camp in Jostens county.

The total number of kids who went to both camps is given as 1155612.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1) For Lawrence county:
35% of L = 78 kids from outside
2) For Jostens county:
55% of J = 52 kids from outside

Now, let's solve these equations to find the values of L and J.

From equation 1, we can express 35% of L as:
0.35 * L = 78

To find L, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.35:
L = 78 / 0.35
L = 222.8571428571429

Since the number of kids is typically a whole number, we can round L to the nearest whole number:
L ≈ 223

Now, let's find J using equation 2:
0.55 * J = 52

To find J, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.55:
J = 52 / 0.55
J = 94.5454545454545

Again, since the number of kids is typically a whole number, we can round J to the nearest whole number:
J ≈ 95

667,"Paco had 37 sweet cookies, 11 salty cookies, and 23 chocolate chip cookies. He ate 5 sweet cookies, 2 salty cookies, and 7 chocolate chip cookies. If he ate 50% more sweet cookies than salty cookies, and 30% more chocolate chip cookies than sweet cookies, how many more sweet cookies than salty cookies did he eat?","Let's first calculate how many cookies of each type Paco ate:

Sweet cookies eaten: 5
Salty cookies eaten: 2
Chocolate chip cookies eaten: 7

According to the problem, Paco ate 50% more sweet cookies than salty cookies. Let's check if this is true with the given numbers:

50% more than 2 salty cookies is 2 + (50% of 2) = 2 + 1 = 3 sweet cookies.

However, Paco actually ate 5 sweet cookies, which is not 50% more than the salty cookies he ate. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. 

Let's proceed with the given numbers:

Paco ate 5 sweet cookies and 2 salty cookies. To find out how many more sweet cookies than salty cookies he ate, we subtract the number of salty cookies from the number of sweet cookies:

5 sweet cookies - 2 salty cookies = 3 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.

So, Paco ate 3 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.","Paco started with a total of 71 cookies. If we consider the number of sweet cookies as the base, Paco ate 22% more sweet cookies than salty ones. He had 30% more chocolate chip cookies left than the number of sweet cookies he ate.

Therefore, the difference in the number of sweet and salty cookies Paco ate is 11 cookies. 

The final result is: 11.","Let's calculate the number of sweet cookies Paco ate first. Since he ate 50% more sweet cookies than salty cookies, we can find the number of salty cookies he ate and then multiply by 1.5 to get the number of sweet cookies.

Paco ate 2 salty cookies, so 1.5 times the number of salty cookies is:
1.5 * 2 = 3 sweet cookies.

Now, let's find out how many chocolate chip cookies Paco ate. He ate 30% more chocolate chip cookies than sweet cookies, so we can find the number of sweet cookies he ate and then multiply by 1.3 to get the number of chocolate chip cookies.

Paco ate 3 sweet cookies, so 1.3 times the number of sweet cookies is:
1.3 * 3 = 3.9 chocolate chip cookies.

Since Paco can't eat a fraction of a cookie, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3 chocolate chip cookies.

Now, let's calculate the number of sweet cookies Paco ate compared to the number of salty cookies he ate:

Sweet cookies eaten = 5
Salty cookies eaten = 2

More sweet cookies than salty cookies = 5 - 2 = 3

So, Paco ate 3 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.",11,3,3

How many shirts did each machine make today and what is the total shirts produced today?","Let's calculate the number of shirts each machine made today:

Machine A:
Today, Machine A worked for 12 minutes and can make 6 shirts a minute. So, the number of shirts Machine A made today is:
6 shirts/minute * 12 minutes = 72 shirts

Machine B:
Today, Machine B worked for 10 minutes and can make 8 shirts a minute. So, the number of shirts Machine B made today is:
8 shirts/minute * 10 minutes = 80 shirts

Machine C:
Today, Machine C worked for 6 minutes and can make 4 shirts a minute. So, the number of shirts Machine C made today is:
4 shirts/minute * 6 minutes = 24 shirts

Now, let's calculate the total number of shirts produced today by all machines:

Total shirts produced today = Shirts by Machine A + Shirts by Machine B + Shirts by Machine C

Campus A:
Grades 1-5 with 100 students per grade, so that's 5 grades * 100 students/grade = 500 students.
Plus, there is a special education program with 30 extra students.
Total for Campus A = 500 + 30 = 530 students.

Additionally, she wants to ensure that the number of eggs in each group is equal to the difference of marbles in the adjacent groups. How many eggs should be in each group?","Let's denote the three groups of eggs as A, B, and C, and let's assume that A has the fewest eggs and C has the most. Since Rebecca wants the number of eggs in each group to be equal to the difference in marbles in the adjacent groups, we can set up the following relationships:

1. The difference in the number of marbles between groups A and B is equal to the number of eggs in group B.
2. The difference in the number of marbles between groups B and C is equal to the number of eggs in group C.

Since Rebecca has 4 marbles, we can distribute them among the three groups in such a way that the differences in marbles between adjacent groups are all different (since the groups of eggs must all be different). The only way to do this with 4 marbles is to have:

- 0 marbles in group A
- 1 marble in group B
- 3 marbles in group C

This gives us the following differences in marbles:

- The difference between groups A and B is 1 marble.
- The difference between groups B and C is 2 marbles.

Therefore, group B must have 1 egg (since it's equal to the difference in marbles between A and B), and group C must have 2 eggs (since it's equal to the difference in marbles between B and C).

Now, we have 15 eggs in total, and we've already allocated 1 egg to group B and 2 eggs to group C. This leaves us with:

15 eggs - 1 egg - 2 eggs = 12 eggs

These 12 eggs must go into group A. However, we must check if this allocation satisfies the condition that the number of eggs in each group is different. Since group A has 12 eggs, group B has 1 egg, and group C has 2 eggs, all groups have a different number of eggs.

So, the number of eggs in each group should be:

- Group A: 12 eggs
- Group B: 1 egg
- Group C: 2 eggs","Rebecca has 4 marbles, and she wants the number of eggs in each group to equal the difference in marbles between the groups. We can start by assigning the number of marbles to the variables X, (M)arbles and E, (G)egs, which gives us:
X + E = 4 + 3E

She also wants to split her 15 eggs into three groups. We can represent the number of eggs in each group as G1, G2, and G3:
G1 + G2 + G3 = 15

The difference in marbles between the groups must be equal to the number of eggs in each group, so G1 - G2 = G2 - G3 = E.
So G1 = 3E + M, G2 = E, and G3 = 2E + M.

Substituting the first equation's value of E into the third equation yields G3 = 2(4 + 3E) + M = 8 + 6E + M.
Adding the three equations together reveals that 6E + 3M = 15, or E + M = 5.

Since both M and E must be integers, we find that M = 2 and E = 3.

Therefore, the number of eggs in each group is **5**.","Let's denote the number of eggs in each group as x. According to the problem, the number of eggs in each group should be equal to the difference of marbles in the adjacent groups.

The difference of marbles in the adjacent groups is 4 (since there are 4 marbles in total and each group has 1 marble less than the adjacent group).

So, there were 21.2 children on the bus after 21.3 got off. Since there are 35.8 children on the bus after some more got on, we can find out how many got on by subtracting the number of children on the bus after the 21.3 got off from the total number of children on the bus now:

35.8 - 21.2 = 14.6

Therefore, 14.6 children got on the bus at the bus stop.","We know that:
Initial children on the bus = 42.5
Children left after some got off = 21.3
Children after others got on = 35.8

We need to find:
Children who got on the bus = ?

We can calculate this by subtracting:
Children left after some got off = 35.8 - 21.3 = 14.5
Children who got on the bus = 14.5 children

Therefore, the final result is 14.5.","Let's denote the number of children who got on the bus as \( x \).

Initially, there were 42.5 children on the bus. After 21.3 children got off, there were \( 42.5 - 21.3 = 21.2 \) children left on the bus.

Then, \( x \) children got on the bus, making the total number of children on the bus \( 21.2 + x \).

According to the information given, after these events, there were 35.8 children altogether on the bus. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ 21.2 + x = 35.8 \]

We can set up three equations based on the information given:

1) After losing 40 soda caps, Danny has 60 soda caps left, so the equation for soda caps is:

She has already put in some cups of flour in the mixing bowl. Later, she realizes she needs to put in 5 more cups of flour than sugar, including all the ingredients used for the cake and the pie. How many cups of flour did she already put in the mixing bowl?","First, let's calculate the total amount of sugar needed for both the cake and the pie:

Cake sugar: 3 and 1/4 cups
Pie sugar: 1 and 3/4 cups

Total sugar = (3 + 1/4) + (1 + 3/4) = 3 + 1 + 1/4 + 3/4 = 4 + 1 = 5 cups

Now, let's calculate the total amount of flour needed for both the cake and the pie:

Cake flour: 10 and 1/2 cups
Pie flour: 7 and 1/2 cups

Total flour = (10 + 1/2) + (7 + 1/2) = 10 + 7 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 17 + 1 = 18 cups

According to the information given, Mary needs to put in 5 more cups of flour than sugar. Since we've calculated that she needs 5 cups of sugar in total, she would need:

5 cups of sugar + 5 cups = 10 cups of flour

However, we've already calculated that she needs 18 cups of flour in total for both recipes. So, to find out how many cups of flour she has already put in the mixing bowl, we subtract the additional 10 cups she needs to add from the total amount of flour required:

18 cups (total flour) - 10 cups (additional flour needed) = 8 cups

Mary has already put in 8 cups of flour in the mixing bowl.","Mary's cake recipe requires 3 + 1/4 cups of sugar and 10 + 1/2 cups of flour, and her pie recipe needs 1 + 3/4 cups of sugar and 7 + 1/2 cups of flour. To simplify these measurements, we can convert the fractions into decimals. This results in sugar requirements of 3.25 and 1.75 cups, and flour requirements of 10.5 and 7.5 cups.

Knowing that she needs to add 5 more cups of flour than sugar, we can infer that she has already added 3.25 cups of sugar to the mixing bowl. According to the problem, this is equivalent to the amount of flour she has already added.

Therefore, Mary has already put 3.25 cups of flour into the mixing bowl.
 
The final result is 3.25.","Let's denote the number of cups of flour Mary already put in the mixing bowl as F.

According to the information given, Mary needs to put in 5 more cups of flour than sugar. This means that for every 1 cup of sugar, she needs to put in 5 + 1 = 6 cups of flour.

For the cake, she needs 3 and 1/4 cups of sugar and 10 and 1/2 cups of flour. To find out how many cups of flour she needs to put in for the cake, we multiply the sugar by 6:

3 and 1/4 cups of sugar * 6 cups of flour per cup of sugar = (3 + 1/4) * 6 = (3.25) * 6 = 19.5 cups of flour

Since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we'll round this to the nearest whole cup. Since 19.5 is closer to 20 than to 19, we'll round up to 20 cups of flour for the cake.

For the pie, she needs 1 and 3/4 cups of sugar and 7 and 1/2 cups of flour. Again, we multiply the sugar by 6 to find out how many cups of flour she needs for the pie:

1 and 3/4 cups of sugar * 6 cups of flour per cup of sugar = (1 + 3/4) * 6 = (1.75) * 6 = 10.5 cups of flour

Again, we'll round this to the nearest whole cup, which is 10 cups of flour for the pie.

Now, we add the flour needed for the cake and the pie to find out the total amount of flour she needs:

20 cups of flour for the cake + 10 cups of flour for the pie = 30 cups of flour

Mary needs to put in 5 more cups of flour than sugar, so we subtract the sugar from the total flour to find out how many cups of flour she already put in the mixing bowl:

30 cups of flour (total) - 3 and 1/4 cups of sugar (for the cake) - 1 and 3/4 cups of sugar (for the pie) = 30 - (3.25 + 1.75) = 30 - 5 = 25 cups of flour

683,"In Philip's collection, there are a total of 980 bananas organized into 250 groups. The first 150 groups have the same number of bananas in each group, while each of the remaining 100 groups has a different number of bananas. The sum of the bananas in the first 150 groups is 735. If the total number of bananas in the remaining groups forms an arithmetic sequence with an integer common difference, determine the number of bananas in each of the first 150 groups and find the first and last term of the arithmetic sequence for the remaining 100 groups.","Let's start by finding the number of bananas in each of the first 150 groups. Since the sum of the bananas in these groups is 735, we can divide this number by 150 to find the number of bananas per group:

735 bananas / 150 groups = 4.9 bananas/group

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a banana in a group, this suggests that there might be an error in the given information. The number of bananas in each group should be a whole number. Could you please confirm the details of the problem?","Let's solve this problem step by step.

We aim to find the number of bananas in each of the first 150 groups and the first and last terms of the arithmetic sequence for the remaining 100 groups.

We know that the sum of the bananas in the first 150 groups is 735, and each group has the same number of bananas. We can calculate the number of bananas in each group by dividing the total sum:
Number of Bananas in each of the first 150 groups = 735 / 150
= 4.9 bananas

For the remaining 100 groups, we are told that the total number of bananas forms an arithmetic sequence with a common integer difference. Let's start by finding the first term. The common difference is given by the formula:
CD = (2 * Last Term) - (First Term)

We know the sum of the remaining groups is 980 - 735 = 245 bananas. Let's assign the first term as 'a' and the common difference as 'd'. Then, we can write the sum of the series as:

245 = (2 * Last Term) - First Term + d * (Number of Terms - 1)

Substituting the known values and equating terms, we get:
245 = 2 * 245 - a + 99d

Solving for 'a', we find the first term to be 147 bananas.

The last term can be found by setting the term number equal to 100:
100 * d + a = Last Term

Substituting the first term we found earlier, we get:
100d + 147 = Last Term

The common difference d can now be found by observing that the last group has a higher number of bananas than the first group, which we found to contain 147 bananas. So:
Last Term > First Term => 100d + 147 > 147
2d > 0.5 => d > 0.25

We can now guess the value of d as 1/4. Substituting into the equation above gives us:

100 * 1/4 + 147 = 151 bananas

So the first term is 147 bananas and the last term is 151 bananas.

Therefore, the final result is 4.9 bananas for the first 150 groups and an arithmetic sequence starting from 147 and ending at 151 bananas for the remaining 100 groups. 
4.9, 147-151","Let's denote the number of bananas in each of the first 150 groups as \( x \).

According to the problem, the sum of the bananas in the first 150 groups is 735. Since there are 150 groups, each with \( x \) bananas, the sum can be expressed as:

\[ 150 \times x = 735 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{735}{150} \]
\[ x = 4.9 \]

Since the number of bananas in each group must be an integer, we can round \( x \) to the nearest integer. The nearest integer to 4.9 is 5. Therefore, the number of bananas in each of the first 150 groups is 5.

Now, let's find the total number of bananas in the first 150 groups:

\[ 150 \times 5 = 750 \]

This means that the total number of bananas in the remaining 100 groups is:

\[ 980 - 750 = 230 \]

Now, we need to find the first and last term of the arithmetic sequence for the remaining 100 groups. Let's denote the common difference as \( d \).

The first term of the arithmetic sequence is the first term of the remaining 100 groups, which is the number of bananas in the 151st group. Since we know the total number of bananas in the remaining groups is 230, we can find the first term by dividing the total number of bananas by the number of groups:

\[ \text{First term} = \frac{230}{100} \]
\[ \text{First term} = 2.3 \]

Since the number of bananas in each group must be an integer, we can round the first term to the nearest integer. The nearest integer to 2.3 is 2. Therefore, the first term of the arithmetic sequence is 2.

Now, let's find the last term of the arithmetic sequence. The last term will be the number of bananas in the last group, which is the 250th group. Since we know the total number of bananas in the remaining groups is 230, we can find the last term by adding the total number of bananas to the sum of the bananas in the first 150 groups:

\[ \text{Last term} = 230 + 750 \]
\[ \text{Last term} = 980 \]

Therefore, the last term of the arithmetic sequence is","4.9, 147-151",980,4.9

686,"Let the number of candy bars Dan bought be represented by x and the cost of each candy bar be represented by y dollars. Dan has a total of $ 2.

The problem can be represented by the equation: 
x × y = 2

Given that each candy bar costs $ 6, we can substitute the value of y in the equation:

x × 6 = 2

Now we have a two-step algebraic equation that represents the problem:

6x = 2","To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

6x / 6 = 2 / 6

This simplifies to:

x = 1/3

However, since Dan cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can conclude that with $2, Dan cannot afford to buy a candy bar that costs $6 each.","We're solving the equation 6x = 2. To solve this, we can simply divide both sides by 6:

6x / 6 = 2 / 6

687,"Jesse's house has three rooms. The first room is a rectangle, 11 feet long and 15 feet wide. The second room is a triangle, with a base of 12 feet and a height of 8 feet. The third room is a circle with a radius of 6 feet.

If Jesse has already bought 16 square feet of carpet, and she has a budget of $800 to cover the rest of the floors, how much more carpet does she need to complete the task?

Additionally, the carpet is available in the following options:

1. Regular Carpet: $5.00 per square foot
2. Deluxe Carpet: $7.50 per square foot
3. Luxury Carpet: $10.00 per square foot

Which type(s) of carpet can Jesse afford to purchase with her remaining budget to cover the rest of the floors?","First, let's calculate the area of each room to determine how much carpet Jesse needs in total.

For the first room, which is a rectangle:
Area = length × width
Area = 11 ft × 15 ft = 165 square feet

For the second room, which is a triangle:
Area = (base × height) / 2
Area = (12 ft × 8 ft) / 2 = 48 square feet

For the third room, which is a circle:
Area = π × radius^2
Area = π × (6 ft)^2 ≈ 3.14159 × 36 ≈ 113.097 square feet

Now, let's add up the areas of all three rooms:
Total area = Area of first room + Area of second room + Area of third room
Total area = 165 sq ft + 48 sq ft + 113.097 sq ft ≈ 326.097 square feet

Jesse has already bought 16 square feet of carpet, so she needs to cover:
Total carpet needed = Total area - Carpet already bought
Total carpet needed ≈ 326.097 sq ft - 16 sq ft ≈ 310.097 square feet

Now, let's see how much carpet Jesse can afford with her remaining budget of $800.

For the Regular Carpet at $5.00 per square foot:
Maximum area Jesse can afford = Budget / Price per square foot
Maximum area Jesse can afford = $800 / $5.00/sq ft = 160 square feet

For the Deluxe Carpet at $7.50 per square foot:
Maximum area Jesse can afford = $800 / $7.50/sq ft ≈ 106.67 square feet

For the Luxury Carpet at $10.00 per square foot:
Maximum area Jesse can afford = $800 / $10.00/sq ft = 80 square feet

Since Jesse needs approximately 310.097 square feet of carpet and her budget is $800, none of the carpet options would cover the entire area needed within her budget. However, she could potentially purchase a combination of different types of carpet or prioritize carpeting certain rooms with the budget she has.","To solve this problem, let's first calculate the area of each room and add them together. 

Room 1: 11 x 15 = 165 sq ft
Room 2: 1/2 x 12 x 8 = 48 sq ft
Room 3: π x 6^2 = 113.04 sq ft

The total area required is 165 + 48 + 113.04 = 326.04 sq ft

Jesse needs an additional 326.04 - 16 = 310.04 sq ft of carpet.

With a budget of $800, Jesse can afford 800 / 5 = 160 sq ft of Regular Carpet, or 800 / 7.5 = 106.67 sq ft of Deluxe Carpet. She cannot afford the Luxury Carpet.

The final result is Regular Carpet or Deluxe Carpet.","First, let's calculate the area of each room that Jesse needs to cover with carpet:

1. Rectangle: The area of a rectangle is length × width. So, the area of the first room is 11 feet × 15 feet = 165 square feet.

2. Triangle: The area of a triangle is (1/2) × base × height. So, the area of the second room is (1/2) × 12 feet × 8 feet = 60 square feet.

3. Circle: The area of a circle is π × radius^2. So, the area of the third room is π × 6 feet^2 ≈ 36π square feet.

Now, let's add up the areas of all three rooms to find the total area Jesse needs to cover:

Total area = Area of rectangle + Area of triangle + Area of circle
Total area = 165 square feet + 60 square feet + 36π square feet
Total area = 255 square feet + 36π square feet
Total area = 255 square feet + 122.88 square feet (approximately)
Total area = 377.88 square feet (approximately)

Jesse has already bought 16 square feet of carpet, so she needs to buy:

Remaining area = Total area - Area already bought
Remaining area = 377.88 square feet - 16 square feet
Remaining area = 361.88 square feet (approximately)

Now, let's calculate how much more carpet Jesse needs to buy:

Amount of carpet needed = Remaining area / Cost per square foot

Jesse has a budget of $800, so let's find out which types of carpet she can afford:

1. Regular Carpet: $5.00 per square foot
Amount of regular carpet she can buy = $800 / $5.00 per square foot
Amount of regular carpet she can buy = 160 square feet

Since Jesse has already bought 16 square feet of carpet, the amount of regular carpet she can buy is:

160 square feet - 16 square feet = 144 square feet

Therefore, Jesse can afford to buy 144 square feet of regular carpet with her remaining budget.

2. Deluxe Carpet: $7.50 per square foot
Amount of deluxe carpet she can buy = $800 / $7.50 per square foot
Amount of deluxe carpet she can buy = 106.67 square feet

Since Jesse has already bought 16 square feet of carpet, the amount of deluxe carpet she can buy is:

688,"There were 25 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 40 roses from the vase, gave away 10 roses to her neighbor, and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 45 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away and gave away combined?","Jessica threw away 40 roses and gave away 10 roses, so she removed a total of 40 + 10 = 50 roses from the vase.

There were originally 25 roses in the vase, and now there are 45 roses. This means she added 45 - 25 = 20 roses to the vase.

To find out how many more roses she cut than those she threw away and gave away combined, we subtract the total number of roses removed (50) from the number of roses added (20):

20 (added) - 50 (removed) = -30

However, since we are looking for how many more roses she cut, we need to consider the difference as a positive number. So, Jessica cut 30 more roses than those she threw away and gave away combined.","Jessica threw away and gave away a total of 40 + 10 = 50 roses.
The number of roses she cut is 45 - 25 = 20 roses.
She cut 20 - 50 = **10** more roses than she threw away and gave away combined.","Jessica started with 25 roses in the vase. She threw away 40 roses, so the number of roses left in the vase was 25 - 40 = 5 roses.

Then she gave away 10 roses to her neighbor, so the number of roses left in the vase was 5 - 10 = -5 roses.

Since you can't have negative roses, we need to correct this. Jessica must have given away 5 roses instead of 10, because she started with 5 roses after throwing away 40.

Now, after giving away 5 roses, there were 5 - 5 = 0 roses left in the vase.

After cutting new roses from her flower garden, there are now 45 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses she cut than those she threw away and gave away combined, we subtract the number of roses she threw away and gave away from the current number of roses in the vase:

45 (current number of roses) - 40 (roses thrown away) - 5 (roses given away) = 0

There is a 10% discount on regular sodas and a 8% sales tax on diet sodas. What is the total combined cost of the regular and diet sodas after the discounts and taxes are applied?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the regular sodas before the discount:

49 bottles of regular soda * $1.20 each = $58.80

Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the regular sodas:

10% of $58.80 = 0.10 * $58.80 = $5.88

Subtract the discount from the original price of the regular sodas:

$58.80 - $5.88 = $52.92

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the diet sodas before tax:

40 bottles of diet soda * $1.10 each = $44.00

Now, let's apply the 8% sales tax to the diet sodas:

8% of $44.00 = 0.08 * $44.00 = $3.52

Add the tax to the original price of the diet sodas:

$44.00 + $3.52 = $47.52

Finally, let's add the total cost of the regular sodas after the discount and the total cost of the diet sodas after tax to get the combined total cost:

$52.92 (regular sodas after discount) + $47.52 (diet sodas after tax) = $100.44

The total combined cost of the regular and diet sodas after the discounts and taxes are applied is $100.44.","Let's solve this step by step.

1. We first calculate the discount on regular sodas. 49 bottles at $1.20 each make $58.80. The 10% discount would cost $5.88.

2. Next, we calculate the price of diet sodas. 40 bottles at $1.10 each come to $44. 

3. We now calculate the sales tax on the diet sodas. 40 bottles at 8% comes to $3.52.

4. Now, we add the discount and tax amounts to get the final cost. $58.80 + $44 + $3.52 = $106.32.

The total cost for the regular and diet sodas after the discounts and taxes is **$106.32**.","First, let's calculate the discount on the regular sodas and the sales tax on the diet sodas.

The discount on the regular sodas is 10% of the total cost of the regular sodas. Since there are 49 bottles of regular soda, the total cost before the discount is 49 bottles * $1.20 each = $58.80.
The discount is 10% of $58.80, which is 0.10 * $58.80 = $5.88.

The sales tax on the diet sodas is 8% of the total cost of the diet sodas. Since there are 40 bottles of diet soda, the total cost before the tax is 40 bottles * $1.10 each = $44.
The tax is 8% of $44, which is 0.08 * $44 = $3.52.

Now, let's calculate the total combined cost of the regular and diet sodas after the discounts and taxes are applied.

The total cost of the regular sodas after the discount is $58.80 - $5.88 = $52.92.
The total cost of the diet sodas after the tax is $44 + $3.52 = $47.52.

For reading and history homework, she spends 20 minutes per page.

Reading homework: 7.25 pages * 20 minutes/page = 145 minutes
History homework: 3.5 pages * 20 minutes/page = 70 minutes

For math and biology homework, she spends twice as much time per page, so 40 minutes per page.

Math homework: 8.5 pages * 40 minutes/page = 340 minutes
Biology homework: 4.75 pages * 40 minutes/page = 190 minutes

Now, let's add up the time for all the homework.

Total time = Reading time + History time + Math time + Biology time
Total time = 145 minutes + 70 minutes + 340 minutes + 190 minutes

Biology: 4.75 pages
History: 3.5 pages

The total is 24 pages. Now, twice the time spent on reading and history homework is 20 minutes x 2 = 40 minutes per page for math and biology homework.
So, the total time needed for Rachel to complete all her homework is 40 minutes x 24 pages = **960 minutes**.

We know that a total of 186 t-shirts were sold during both games, and 172 were sold during the Arkansas game. So:

T-shirts sold during Texas Tech game = Total t-shirts sold - T-shirts sold during Arkansas game
T-shirts sold during Texas Tech game = 186 - 172

186 (total t-shirts sold) - 172 (t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game) = 14 t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.

Now, let's calculate the total discount given during the Texas Tech game.

Since there is no discount for the first 50 t-shirts, we only need to consider the next 14 t-shirts sold.

For the first 50 t-shirts, there is no discount, so the discount for those t-shirts is $0.

For the next 14 t-shirts, if they are between 51 and 100 t-shirts, they get a $5 discount per t-shirt. So, the discount for these 14 t-shirts is:

14 t-shirts * $5 discount per t-shirt = $70 discount.

After eating x pieces, he shared half of that amount with his friend, so he gave away x/2 pieces to his friend.

After sharing, he ate 5 more pieces.

He started with 22 pieces and ended up with 8 pieces. So, the pieces he ate and shared should be equal to the difference between the starting amount and the remaining amount.

So we can write the equation:

22 - (x + x/2 + 5) = 8

Now, let's solve for x:

22 - x - x/2 - 5 = 8
22 - 5 - 8 = x + x/2

Remaining cakes = Initial cakes - Sold cakes
Remaining cakes = 167.3 - 108.2
Remaining cakes = 59.1

Baker would still have 59.1 cakes.","Baker initially had 167.3 cakes and 61.5 pastries. 

He sold 108.2 cakes, so by subtracting this number from the initial amount, Baker has 59.1 cakes left. 

The final result is 59. 
59 cakes.","First, let's find out how many cakes and pastries Baker still has by subtracting the number of cakes and pastries he sold from the total number of cakes and pastries he made.

For cakes:
Total cakes made = 167.3
Cakes sold = 108.2
Cakes still have = Total cakes made - Cakes sold
Cakes still have = 167.3 - 108.2
Cakes still have = 59.1

For pastries:
Total pastries made = 61.5
Pastries sold = 44.2
Pastries still have = Total pastries made - Pastries sold
Pastries still have = 61.5 - 44.2
Pastries still have = 17.3

Now, let's add the number of cakes and pastries still have to find out the total number of cakes and pastries Baker still has:

Total cakes and pastries still have = Cakes still have + Pastries still have
Total cakes and pastries still have = 59.1 + 17.3
Total cakes and pastries still have = 76.4

How many more cups of flour and teaspoons of baking powder than cups of sugar does she need to add now?","Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, so she needs to add 12 - 2 = 10 more cups of flour.

She has already added 1 teaspoon of baking powder, so she needs to add 6 - 1 = 5 more teaspoons of baking powder.

The recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar, and she has not added any yet, so she still needs to add 8 cups of sugar.

Now, to find out how many more cups of flour and teaspoons of baking powder than cups of sugar she needs to add:

More cups of flour than cups of sugar: 10 (cups of flour) - 8 (cups of sugar) = 2 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.

More teaspoons of baking powder than cups of sugar: 5 (teaspoons of baking powder) - 8 (cups of sugar) = -3, which means she needs 3 fewer teaspoons of baking powder than cups of sugar, not more.

698,"Paul got a box of crayons for his birthday, which included three types of crayons - small, medium, and large. He gave away 2/5 of the small crayons, lost 3/4 of the medium crayons, and kept 4/7 of the large crayons. At the end of the school year, he had 60 small crayons, 98 medium crayons, and 168 large crayons left. How many small, medium, and large crayons did he initially have, and how many crayons had been lost or given away in total?","Let's start by calculating how many crayons Paul initially had for each size.

For the small crayons, Paul gave away 2/5 of them, which means he kept 3/5 of them. If he had 60 small crayons left, which is 3/5 of the initial amount, we can set up the following equation to find the initial amount (S):

3/5 * S = 60

To find S, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:

S = 60 * (5/3)
S = 100

So, Paul initially had 100 small crayons.

For the medium crayons, Paul lost 3/4 of them, which means he kept 1/4 of them. If he had 98 medium crayons left, which is 1/4 of the initial amount, we can set up the following equation to find the initial amount (M):

1/4 * M = 98

To find M, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 1/4, which is 4/1:

M = 98 * (4/1)
M = 392

So, Paul initially had 392 medium crayons.

For the large crayons, Paul kept 4/7 of them. If he had 168 large crayons left, which is 4/7 of the initial amount, we can set up the following equation to find the initial amount (L):

4/7 * L = 168

To find L, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 4/7, which is 7/4:

L = 168 * (7/4)
L = 294

So, Paul initially had 294 large crayons.

Now, let's calculate how many crayons had been lost or given away in total.

For the small crayons, he gave away 2/5 of them:

Lost/given away small crayons = 2/5 * 100 = 40

For the medium crayons, he lost 3/4 of them:

Lost/given away medium crayons = 3/4 * 392 = 294

For the large crayons, he kept 4/7 of them, so he lost 3/7 of them:

Lost/given away large crayons = 3/7 * 294 = 126

Adding up all the lost/given away crayons:

Total lost/given away = 40 (small) + 294 (medium) + 126 (large)
Total lost/given away = 460

In total, Paul lost or gave away 460 crayons.","Let's use S, M, and L to represent the initial number of small, medium, and large crayons, respectively. 

We know that after the school year:
- 60 small crayons were left (2/5 were given away)
- 98 medium crayons were left (3/4 were lost)
- 168 large crayons were left (4/7 were kept)

Setting up three equations, we can solve for the values of S, M, and L:
1. 2/5 * S = 60
2. 3/4 * M = 98
3. 4/7 * L = 168

Multiplying both sides of each equation by the denominator, we get:
1. S = 72
2. M = 144
3. L = 240

The total number of crayons lost or given away is (S + M + L) - (60 + 98 + 168):
(72 + 144 + 240) - (60 + 98 + 168) = 492 - 326 = 166 crayons

Therefore, Paul initially had 492 crayons, and 166 of them were lost or given away.

166","Let's denote the initial number of small, medium, and large crayons as S, M, and L respectively.

According to the information given, Paul gave away 2/5 of the small crayons, lost 3/4 of the medium crayons, and kept 4/7 of the large crayons.

At the end of the school year, he had 60 small crayons, 98 medium crayons, and 168 large crayons left.

So we can write the following equations based on the information given:

1) For small crayons:
2/5 * S = 60

2) For medium crayons:
3/4 * M = 98

3) For large crayons:
4/7 * L = 168

Now, let's solve each equation to find the initial number of each type of crayon.

For small crayons:
2/5 * S = 60
S = 60 * (5/2)
S = 60 * 2.5
S = 150

For medium crayons:
3/4 * M = 98
M = 98 * (4/3)
M = 98 * 1.3333
M ≈ 130

For large crayons:
4/7 * L = 168
L = 168 * (7/4)
L = 168 * 1.75
L = 294

Now, let's calculate the total number of crayons Paul initially had:
S + M + L = 150 + 130 + 294
S + M + L = 674

To find out how many crayons had been lost or given away in total, we need to calculate the total number of crayons Paul initially had and then subtract the number of crayons he had left at the end of the school year.

Total crayons lost or given away = Initial crayons - Remaining crayons
Total crayons lost or given away = 674 - (60 + 98 + 168)
Total crayons lost or given away = 674 - 326
Total crayons lost or given away = 348

So, Paul initially had 674 crayons, and 348 crayons had been lost or given away in total.",One hundred sixty-six,348,460
699,"Dan has $12. He went to the store to buy a candy bar, a bag of chips, and a bottle of soda. The candy bar costs $2, the bag of chips costs $3.50, and the bottle of soda costs $4. There is a 20% discount on the candy bar and a $1-off coupon for the bottle of soda. How much did Dan spend in total, and how much money does he have left after his purchases?","First, let's calculate the discounted price of the candy bar. The candy bar costs $2, and there is a 20% discount on it.

20% of $2 is (20/100) * $2 = $0.40.

So, the discounted price of the candy bar is $2 - $0.40 = $1.60.

Next, let's calculate the price of the bottle of soda with the $1-off coupon. The bottle of soda costs $4, and there is a $1-off coupon.

So, the price of the bottle of soda after the coupon is $4 - $1 = $3.

Now, let's add up the cost of all three items:

Candy bar: $1.60
Bag of chips: $3.50
Bottle of soda: $3

Total cost = $1.60 + $3.50 + $3 = $8.10

Dan started with $12, so let's subtract the total cost of the items from his starting amount to find out how much he has left:

$12 - $8.10 = $3.90

Dan spent $8.10 in total, and he has $3.90 left after his purchases.","Dan's total cost before discounts is $9.50. He has a 20% discount on the $2 candy bar, which amounts to $0.40 off. With the discount, the candy bar now costs $1.60. There's also a $1-off coupon for the bottle of soda, reducing its price to $3. 

So after these discounts, the total cost is $9.10. 

Dan has $3 left.

Money: $3","First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before any discounts or coupons:

Candy bar: $2
Bag of chips: $3.50
Bottle of soda: $4

Total cost before discounts and coupons: $2 + $3.50 + $4 = $9.50

Now, let's apply the discounts and coupons:

Discount on the candy bar: 20% of $2 = 0.20 * $2 = $0.40
Discount on the candy bar: $2 - $0.40 = $1.60

Coupon for the bottle of soda: $1 off

Total cost after discounts and coupons: $9.50 - $0.40 - $1 = $8.10

Now, let's calculate how much money Dan has left after his purchases:

Dan started with $12. After spending $8.10, he has:

$12 - $8.10 = $3.90

So, Dan spent $8.10 in total and has $3.90 left after his purchases.",three,3.90,3.90
700,"Paul had 50 books. He went to a garage sale where they were selling mystery, science fiction, and romance books. The mystery books were on sale: buy 2, get 1 free. For the science fiction books, there was a 20% discount, and romance books cost their original price. 

Here are the prices of the books:
- Mystery books: $4 each
- Science fiction books: $6 each (before discount)
- Romance books: $5 each

If Paul spent $90 at the garage sale and bought the same number of books in each category, how many books did he buy in total, considering the discounts and promotions?","Let's denote the number of books Paul bought in each category as x.

For mystery books, since it's a buy 2 get 1 free deal, for every 3 books, Paul only pays for 2. So, the cost for x mystery books would be:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times $4 \]

For science fiction books, there's a 20% discount on each book. So, the cost for x science fiction books would be:
\[ x \times ($6 \times 0.8) \]

For romance books, there's no discount, so the cost for x romance books would be:
\[ x \times $5 \]

Paul spent $90 in total, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times $4 + x \times ($6 \times 0.8) + x \times $5 = $90 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost for each category and solve for x:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times $4 = \frac{8}{3}x \]
\[ x \times ($6 \times 0.8) = $4.8x \]
\[ x \times $5 = $5x \]

Adding these up:
\[ \frac{8}{3}x + $4.8x + $5x = $90 \]

To combine the terms, we need to have a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 3 is 3, so we convert $4.8x and $5x to fractions with the denominator 3:
\[ \frac{8}{3}x + \frac{14.4}{3}x + \frac{15}{3}x = $90 \]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{8}{3}x + \frac{14.4}{3}x + \frac{15}{3}x = \frac{37.4}{3}x \]

Now, we solve for x:
\[ \frac{37.4}{3}x = $90 \]
\[ x = \frac{90 \times 3}{37.4} \]
\[ x = \frac{270}{37.4} \]
\[ x = 7.219251336898395 \]

Since Paul can't buy a fraction of a book, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 7 books in each category.

So, Paul bought 7 mystery books, 7 science fiction books, and 7 romance books, for a total of:
\[ 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 \text{ books} \]","Paul bought a total of 18 books.

Let's break down the spending:

- Mystery books: $4 x 2 = $8 for two books, and getting one free, Paul would buy 3 books for $8, which is $2.67 per book. The total number of mystery books bought is 3.

- Science fiction books: With a 20% discount, each book now costs $6 - $1.20 = $4.80. If Paul bought the same number of these books as the other two genres, he spent $4.80 x 3 = $14.40 on science fiction.

- Romance books: $5 x 3 = $15 spent on three books.

In total, Paul bought 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 books from each genre.
9 x 3 = 27 books in total.
Since that doesn't add up to the $90 he spent, Paul must have bought additional books from the mystery genre, spending another $90 - $27 * 3 = $18 on them.
So, 27 + 6 = **18** books in total.","Let's calculate the total cost for each type of book after considering the discounts and promotions.

For the mystery books, Paul bought 2 books and got 1 free, so he bought 3 mystery books in total. The cost for the mystery books is:
3 mystery books * $4 each = $12

For the science fiction books, Paul got a 20% discount, so he paid 80% of the original price. The cost for the science fiction books is:
$6 (original price) * 80% = $4.80 per book

Paul bought the same number of science fiction books as mystery books, so he bought 3 science fiction books in total. The total cost for the science fiction books is:
3 science fiction books * $4.80 each = $14.40

For the romance books, Paul paid the original price, which is $5 each. He bought the same number of romance books as mystery books, so he bought 3 romance books in total. The total cost for the romance books is:
3 romance books * $5 each = $15

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the books:
$12 (mystery) + $14.40 (science fiction) + $15 (romance) = $41.40

Paul spent $90 in total, so the number of books he bought is:
$90 / $41.40 per book ≈ 2.17 books

701,"There are 350 pots in a garden. In each pot, there are x flowers and y sticks. The ratio of flowers to the total number of items in a pot is 3:5. In total, how many flowers are there in all pots?","Let's denote the total number of items in a pot as T. According to the ratio given, for every 3 flowers, there are 5 total items in a pot. This means that flowers make up 3/5 of the total items in each pot.

So, if T is the total number of items in a pot, then the number of flowers in each pot (x) is (3/5)T.

Since we know that the total number of items in a pot is the sum of the number of flowers and sticks, we can write:

T = x + y

But we also know that x = (3/5)T, so we can substitute this into the equation:

T = (3/5)T + y

This equation doesn't help us find the value of T, but we don't actually need to find T to answer the question. We just need to know that 3/5 of the items in each pot are flowers.

Now, we need to find the total number of flowers in all 350 pots. Since each pot has (3/5)T flowers, and there are 350 pots, the total number of flowers in all pots is:

Total flowers = 350 * (3/5)T

Since we don't know the value of T, we can't simplify this any further. However, we can see that the total number of flowers is 3/5 of the total number of items in all pots. If we knew the value of T, we could calculate the exact number of flowers. Without that information, we can only express the total number of flowers as a fraction of the total number of items in all pots.","We are asked to find the total number of flowers across all the pots, which we'll express as x. 

We are given the ratio of flowers to the total items in a pot: 3 flowers / 5 items. 

We know the total number of items in each pot is x + y, so we can set up the equation as follows: 
3x / (x + y) = 3:5

Simplifying gives: 9x = 15x + 9y, and subtracting 9x from both sides leaves us with 6x = 9y. 

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 3y. 

Each pot contains 3y flowers. Multiplying by the number of pots, which is 350, we get a total of 1,050 flowers across all the pots. 

**1,050**","Let's denote the total number of items in a pot as T. According to the given ratio, the number of flowers in a pot is 3T/5, and the number of sticks is 2T/5.

Since there are x flowers and y sticks in each pot, we can write the following equation:

3x/5 = 3T/5

This equation tells us that the number of flowers in a pot is equal to the number of flowers in the total items in a pot.

Now, let's find the total number of items in all pots. Since there are 350 pots, and each pot contains T items, the total number of items is:

350 * T

Now, let's find the total number of flowers in all pots. Since each pot contains 3x/5 flowers, the total number of flowers is:

350 * (3x/5)

To simplify this, we can multiply the number of pots by the number of flowers per pot and then divide by the total number of items per pot:

350 * (3x/5) / (3x/5) = 350 * (3x/5) / (2x/5)

Now, let's simplify the fraction:

350 * (3x/5) / (2x/5) = 350 * (3/2) * (x/x)

Since 3/2 is equal to 1.5, we can simplify the equation to:

350 * (1.5x/x)

Now, let's simplify the fraction:

350 * (1.5x/x) = 350 * (1.5)

Since 350 * 1.5 is equal to 525, we can write:

350 * (1.5x/x) = 525

Now, let's solve for x:

1.5x = 525 / 350
1.5x = 1.5
x = 1

So, there is 1 flower in each pot. Now, let's find the total number of flowers in all pots:

350 * (1 flower/pot) = 350 flowers

Therefore, there are 350 flowers in all pots.",1050,350,3/5

What is the difference between the total number of red peaches and green peaches in all baskets?","First, let's calculate the total number of red and green peaches in the odd-numbered baskets. Since there are 20 baskets and half of them are odd-numbered, there are 10 odd-numbered baskets.

In each odd-numbered basket, there are 12 red peaches and 22 green peaches. So, for all odd-numbered baskets:
Total red peaches in odd-numbered baskets = 12 peaches/basket * 10 baskets = 120 peaches
Total green peaches in odd-numbered baskets = 22 peaches/basket * 10 baskets = 220 peaches

Next, let's calculate the total number of red and green peaches in the even-numbered baskets. Since there are also 10 even-numbered baskets:
In each even-numbered basket, there are 15 red peaches and 20 green peaches. So, for all even-numbered baskets:
Total red peaches in even-numbered baskets = 15 peaches/basket * 10 baskets = 150 peaches
Total green peaches in even-numbered baskets = 20 peaches/basket * 10 baskets = 200 peaches

Now, let's add the totals from the odd and even-numbered baskets to get the grand total for red and green peaches:
Total red peaches = 120 (from odd) + 150 (from even) = 270 peaches
Total green peaches = 220 (from odd) + 200 (from even) = 420 peaches

Finally, let's find the difference between the total number of red peaches and green peaches:
Difference = Total green peaches - Total red peaches
Difference = 420 peaches - 270 peaches = 150 peaches

So, the difference between the total number of red peaches and green peaches in all baskets is 150 peaches.","Let's solve this problem step by step.

We need to find the total number of red peaches and compare it with the total number of green peaches.

The odd-numbered baskets have 12 red peaches and 22 green peaches, so the total is 34 red peaches and 44 green peaches. There are half the number of baskets that have these amounts of peaches.

The even-numbered baskets have 15 red and 20 green peaches, so 30 red peaches and 40 green peaches in total. There are half the number of these baskets too.

The total numbers of red and green peaches are 64 and 84 respectively when adding these amounts up and multiplying by two to get the overall total.

Red peaches = 12
Green peaches = 22

Red peaches = 15
Green peaches = 20

Now, let's add up the red and green peaches for each type of basket:

Odd-numbered baskets:
Red peaches = 12
Green peaches = 22

Green peaches = 22 (from odd-numbered baskets) + 20 (from even-numbered baskets) = 42

Finally, let's find the difference between the total number of red peaches and green peaches in all baskets:

For the eggs:
57 eggs / 7 eggs per group = 8 groups with 1 egg remaining (since 57 is not exactly divisible by 7).

For the bananas:
120 bananas / 10 bananas per group = 12 groups (since 120 is exactly divisible by 10).

For the marbles:
248 marbles / 8 marbles per group = 31 groups with no marbles remaining (since 248 is exactly divisible by 8).

705,"The farmers harvested oranges and apples in their orchard. Over the course of 20 days, they harvested 56 sacks of oranges and 35 sacks of apples. If they harvested oranges every 2 days and apples every 3 days, how many sacks of oranges and apples were harvested per day on the days when these two fruits were harvested together?","To find out how many days the farmers harvested both oranges and apples together, we need to find the common multiple of the days they harvested each fruit. Since oranges were harvested every 2 days and apples every 3 days, we look for the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3.

The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6, which means that every 6 days, both oranges and apples were harvested together.

Now, we need to find out how many times within the 20 days they harvested both fruits together. We divide 20 by 6, which gives us 3 with a remainder of 2. This means that there were 3 full cycles of 6 days where both fruits were harvested together.

Next, we need to find out how many sacks of each fruit were harvested on the days they were harvested together. Since they harvested 56 sacks of oranges over 20 days, and oranges were harvested every 2 days, we divide 56 by the number of days oranges were harvested (20 days / 2 days = 10 days). This gives us:

56 sacks / 10 days = 5.6 sacks of oranges per day (on the days they were harvested).

Similarly, since they harvested 35 sacks of apples over 20 days, and apples were harvested every 3 days, we divide 35 by the number of days apples were harvested (20 days / 3 days = 6 days with a remainder, but we only consider full days). This gives us:

35 sacks / 6 days = 5.8333 sacks of apples per day (on the days they were harvested).

On the days when both fruits were harvested together, we add the sacks of oranges and apples together:

5.6 sacks of oranges + 5.8333 sacks of apples = 11.4333 sacks of both fruits per day (on the days they were harvested together).

Since we can't have a fraction of a sack, we can round this to the nearest whole number if needed. However, the exact number is 11.4333 sacks per day on the days when both fruits were harvested together.","To find the number of sacks harvested daily on days when both oranges and apples are harvested, we first determine the common multiple of the frequency of orange and apple harvests, which is 6. 

Next, we divide the total number of sacks of oranges and apples by the common frequency:
- 56 sacks / 2 = 28 sacks of oranges in 6 days
- 35 sacks / 3 = 11.67 sacks of apples in 6 days
- 28 + 12 = 40 sacks in 6 days

The number of sacks harvested on the days when these two fruits were harvested together is 40/6, or 6.67 sacks per day. 

Therefore, the final result is 6.7.

Peace.","The farmers harvested oranges every 2 days and apples every 3 days. To find out how many days they harvested both fruits together, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3, which is 6.

So, they harvested both fruits together every 6 days.

Now, let's calculate how many sacks of each fruit they harvested per day on those days when both fruits were harvested together.

For oranges, they harvested 56 sacks over 20 days, so they harvested 56 / 20 = 2.8 sacks of oranges per day.

For apples, they harvested 35 sacks over 20 days, so they harvested 35 / 20 = 1.75 sacks of apples per day.

Since they can't harvest a fraction of a sack, we'll round the number of sacks of apples to the nearest whole number. In this case, they harvested 1.75 sacks of apples per day, which we can round to 2 sacks per day.

So, on the days when both fruits were harvested together, they harvested 2.8 sacks of oranges and 2 sacks of apples per day.",7,2.8 sacks of oranges and 2 sacks of apples,11.4333
706,"Frank has 120 pieces of candy. He puts an equal number of candies in each bag, using between 5 to 8 bags. How many candies will be in each bag for each possible number of bags?","To find out how many candies will be in each bag for each possible number of bags, we need to divide the total number of candies (120) by each possible number of bags (5, 6, 7, and 8) and see if it results in a whole number, since Frank is putting an equal number of candies in each bag.

1. If Frank uses 5 bags:
120 candies ÷ 5 bags = 24 candies per bag

2. If Frank uses 6 bags:
120 candies ÷ 6 bags = 20 candies per bag

3. If Frank uses 7 bags:
120 candies ÷ 7 bags = approximately 17.14 candies per bag
Since we cannot have a fraction of a candy in a bag, 7 bags will not work for an equal distribution.

4. If Frank uses 8 bags:
120 candies ÷ 8 bags = 15 candies per bag

So, Frank can put 24 candies in each bag if he uses 5 bags, 20 candies in each bag if he uses 6 bags, and 15 candies in each bag if he uses 8 bags. Using 7 bags would not result in an equal number of candies in each bag.","Frank has 120 candies which he wants to distribute evenly across 5 bags, which is the minimum number of bags mentioned.

The final result is 24.","Let's calculate the number of candies in each bag for each possible number of bags from 5 to 8.

If Frank uses 5 bags, he will divide the 120 candies equally among the 5 bags. To find out how many candies will be in each bag, we divide the total number of candies by the number of bags:

120 candies ÷ 5 bags = 24 candies per bag

If Frank uses 6 bags, he will divide the 120 candies equally among the 6 bags. To find out how many candies will be in each bag, we divide the total number of candies by the number of bags:

120 candies ÷ 6 bags = 20 candies per bag

If Frank uses 7 bags, he will divide the 120 candies equally among the 7 bags. To find out how many candies will be in each bag, we divide the total number of candies by the number of bags:

120 candies ÷ 7 bags = 17.14 candies per bag (since we can't have a fraction of a candy, this would not be a practical number of bags for Frank to use)

If Frank uses 8 bags, he will divide the 120 candies equally among the 8 bags. To find out how many candies will be in each bag, we divide the total number of candies by the number of bags:

120 candies ÷ 8 bags = 15 candies per bag

So, if Frank uses 5 bags, each bag will contain 24 candies. If he uses 6 bags, each bag will contain 20 candies. If he uses 8 bags, each bag will contain 15 candies. However, if he uses 7 bags, it would not be practical since he can't have a fraction of a candy.",24,Fifteen.,15

Number of seats = 8 / 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a seat on a Ferris wheel, we need to round up to the nearest whole number because you can't have a partial seat. 

So, the Ferris wheel would need to have 3 seats to accommodate 8 people, with 2 seats fully occupied (3 people each) and 1 seat with 2 people (since 3 + 3 + 2 = 8). 

Therefore, the Ferris wheel has 3 seats.","We know that 8 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, and each seat holds 3 people. We can divide the total capacity by the capacity per seat:

There are now 37 roses in the vase. How many roses did Jessica cut from her garden?","Jessica had 7 roses in the vase initially. After all the transactions, she ended up with 37 roses in the vase.

To find out how many roses she added to the vase, we subtract the initial number of roses from the final number:
37 roses (final) - 7 roses (initial) = 30 roses added to the vase.

Jessica gave Sarah 10 roses back. These 10 roses were part of the roses she cut from the garden before adding the rest to the vase.

So, to find out the total number of roses Jessica cut from the garden, we add the roses she gave to Sarah to the roses she added to the vase:
30 roses (added to the vase) + 10 roses (given to Sarah) = 40 roses cut from the garden.

Jessica cut 40 roses from her garden.","Jessica started with 7 roses in the vase and ended up with 37 after giving Sarah 10 roses, which means 37 - 10 = 27 roses were in the vase after Sarah's request.
Adding this to the roses given by Sarah, we get a total of 27 + 15 = 42 roses.
This means that Jessica cut 84 - 42 = 42 roses from her garden.

How much more money did he spend on the candy bar than he did on the chocolate after applying the discounts?","First, let's calculate the discounted price of the candy bar. The original price is $6, and it has a 25% discount.

The discount amount for the candy bar is 25% of $6:
(25/100) * $6 = $1.50

So, the discounted price of the candy bar is:
$6 - $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the discounted price of the chocolate. The original price is $3, and it has a 10% discount.

The discount amount for the chocolate is 10% of $3:
(10/100) * $3 = $0.30

So, the discounted price of the chocolate is:
$3 - $0.30 = $2.70

Now, let's find out how much more Dan spent on the candy bar than on the chocolate after applying the discounts:

Dan spent $0.68 more on the candy bar.

Sixty-eight cents.","First, let's calculate the discounts for each item.

For the candy bar:
Discount = 25% of $6
Discount = 0.25 * $6

He spends 1.5 hours on learning German and 4 hours on learning Spanish, which adds up to 1.5 + 4 = 5.5 hours.

To find out how many more hours he spends on learning Chinese and French combined than on learning German and Spanish combined, we subtract the total hours for German and Spanish from the total hours for Chinese and French:

8 hours (Chinese + French) - 5.5 hours (German + Spanish) = 2.5 hours.

Ryan spends 2.5 more hours on learning Chinese and French combined than he does on learning German and Spanish combined.","Ryan spends 8.5 hours learning Chinese and French.

711,"Let p be the number of pages per book, d be the number of days it takes Frank to finish each book, and t be the total number of days Frank spends reading all the books. We are given the following information:

1. p = 2a (where a is an integer, and p is an even number)
2. d = 3b (where b is an integer, and d is a multiple of 3)
3. t = 2c * 3b (where c is an integer, and t is both even and a multiple of 3)

If Frank reads n books, we know that n*p = t and that he spends n*d days reading all the books, which gives us two equations:

n * (2a) = 2c * 3b
n * (3b) = t

Determine n, the number of books Frank reads, given the system of equations above.","We have two equations:

1. n * (2a) = 2c * 3b
2. n * (3b) = t

From equation 2, we can express n in terms of t and b:

n = t / (3b)

We know that t = 2c * 3b, so we can substitute this into the equation for n:

n = (2c * 3b) / (3b)

The 3b terms cancel out:

n = 2c

Since c is an integer and n is equal to 2c, n must also be an integer. Therefore, n is the number of books Frank reads, and it is an even number because it is 2 times an integer (c). The exact value of n depends on the value of c, which is not provided in the information given.","We're asked to find the number of books Frank reads, which we'll call variable n. 

We're given:
p = 2a
d = 3b
t = 6cb

We can solve:
n * 2a = 6cb
n * 3b = 6cb

We see that n cancels out with both equations:
2a = 3bc
3b = 6cb

We can divide both equations by 3b and 2a respectively to find:
c = b
b = a

We're almost there; let's keep solving:

6a = t / n
3a = d / n

We can see that 3a and 6a are multiples of each other. They must have the same value for t to be even and a multiple of 3. So, we can conclude that:

6a = 3b = d

We can now find n by dividing t by the number of pages per book:
n = t / p = 6cb / 2a

Substituting c = b, we get:
n = 3b^2

The final answer is: 3.","Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

1. From the given information, we know that p is an even number and d is a multiple of 3. We can express p and d in terms of integers a and b as follows:

p = 2a
d = 3b

2. We are given that t is both even and a multiple of 3. We can express t in terms of integers c and b as follows:

t = 2c * 3b

3. We are also given that n*p = t, which means the number of pages Frank reads is equal to the total number of days he spends reading all the books. We can express this as:

n * p = t

4. Now we have two equations:

a) n * (2a) = 2c * 3b
b) n * (3b) = t

5. To solve for n, we need to express t in terms of n and p, and then substitute that expression into the second equation.

From the first equation, we can express t in terms of n and p:

t = n * (2a)

6. Now we substitute t from the first equation into the second equation:

n * (3b) = n * (2a)

7. To solve for n, we need to find a common denominator for the terms involving n. Since p is even and d is a multiple of 3, we can express p and d in terms of 2 and 3:

p = 2 * 2 = 4
d = 3 * 3 = 9

8. Now we have:

n * (3 * 3) = n * (2 * 2)

9. To find a common denominator, we can factor out n:

n * (3 * 3) = n * (2 * 2)
n * (9) = n * (4)

10. Since 9 and 4 are both multiples of 3, we can express both terms as multiples of 3:

n * (3 * 3) = n * (3 * 3)
n * (9) = n * (9)

11. Now we have:

n * (9) = n * (9)

This means that the two expressions on the left and right sides of the equation are equal to each other, and therefore, n does not appear in the equation. However, we know that t is a multiple of 3, and we have expressed t as 2c * 3b. Since c is an integer, we can express t as:

t = 2 * 3 * b * c

Now, let's find out the total number of pages she had to complete for both subjects:

10 pages (math) + 13 pages (reading) = 23 pages (total)

Rachel spent a total of 4 hours studying for both subjects. To find the average time she spends per page for each subject, we divide the total time spent by the total number of pages:

4 hours = 4 * 60 minutes = 240 minutes

Average time per page = Total time spent / Total number of pages
Average time per page = 240 minutes / 23 pages ≈ 10.43 minutes per page

13.","Rachel had to complete 10 pages of math homework and 3 more pages of reading homework than math homework, so she had to complete 10 + 3 = 13 pages of reading homework.

She spent a total of 4 hours studying for both subjects, so we can calculate the total number of pages she had to complete by dividing the total time spent by the average time per page for each subject.

Let's assume the average time per page for math homework is x hours. Then the average time per page for reading homework would also be x hours, because she spends the same amount of time on each page of math homework as she does on each page of reading homework.

The total number of pages for both subjects is 10 (math homework) + 13 (reading homework) = 23 pages.

Now we can set up the equation:

4 hours = (10 + 13) pages * x hours/page

Combining the pages, we get:

So, each friend will get 9 crackers, 10 cakes, and 5 cookies. Since the question asks specifically about cakes, each person ate 10 cakes.","Matthew had a total of 29 + 30 + 15 = 74 items of food.
So Matthew and his 3 friends each got 74 / 4 = 18.5 items.
Therefore, each of them ate 18.5 / 3 = 6.2 cakes.
**6**","First, let's find out how many crackers, cakes, and cookies each of Matthew's friends received.

Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers, cakes, and cookies to his 3 friends, we divide the total number of each item by 3.

For crackers:
29 crackers ÷ 3 friends = 9.6666... crackers per friend

For cakes:
30 cakes ÷ 3 friends = 10 cakes per friend

For cookies:
15 cookies ÷ 3 friends = 5 cookies per friend

Now, let's find out how many cakes each person ate. Since we are only concerned with the number of cakes, we can disregard the number of crackers and cookies.

Additionally, Jake and Steven received 10 grapes each from their neighbor. How many apples and bananas does Jake have, and how many grapes do Jake and Steven have combined?","Let's calculate the number of apples and bananas Jake has:

Apples:
Steven has 8 apples. Jake has 3 more apples than Steven.
Jake's apples = Steven's apples + 3
Jake's apples = 8 + 3
Jake's apples = 11

Bananas:
Steven has 4 bananas. Jake has twice as many bananas as Steven.
Jake's bananas = Steven's bananas * 2
Jake's bananas = 4 * 2
Jake's bananas = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of grapes Jake and Steven have combined:

Jake received 10 grapes from their neighbor.
Steven also received 10 grapes from their neighbor.
Combined grapes = Jake's grapes + Steven's grapes
Combined grapes = 10 + 10
Combined grapes = 20

So, Jake has 11 apples and 8 bananas, and together, Jake and Steven have 20 grapes.","Jake has 6 apples and 8 bananas.
Together, Jake and Steven have 20 grapes.

Harmony.","First, let's find out how many peaches, apples, and bananas Jake has.

Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has:
9 peaches (Steven's number) - 13 = 6 peaches

Jake has 3 more apples than Steven, so he has:
8 apples (Steven's number) + 3 = 11 apples

Jake has twice as many bananas as Steven, so he has:
4 bananas (Steven's number) * 2 = 8 bananas

Now, let's find out how many grapes Jake and Steven have combined.

Jake and Steven each received 10 grapes from their neighbor, so together they have:
10 grapes (Jake's number) + 10 grapes (Steven's number) = 20 grapes

In summary, Jake has 6 peaches, 11 apples, 8 bananas, and 10 grapes. Jake and Steven have 20 grapes combined.",20,Twenty.,Twenty.
718,Jake has 12 fewer peaches and 79 more apples than Steven. Steven has 19 peaches and 14 apples. Emily has twice as many peaches as Jake and 23 fewer apples than Steven. How many peaches does Jake have and how many apples does Emily have?,"Let's start by finding out how many peaches Jake has. Since Steven has 19 peaches and Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, we can calculate the number of peaches Jake has by subtracting 12 from the number of peaches Steven has:

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 12
Jake's peaches = 19 - 12
Jake's peaches = 7

Now, let's find out how many apples Emily has. Since Steven has 14 apples and Emily has 23 fewer apples than Steven, we can calculate the number of apples Emily has by subtracting 23 from the number of apples Steven has:

Emily's apples = Steven's apples - 23
Emily's apples = 14 - 23
Emily's apples = -9

However, it's not possible to have a negative number of apples, so there might be a mistake in the information provided or in the calculation. Let's recheck the calculation:

Emily's apples = Steven's apples - 23
Emily's apples = 14 - 23
Emily's apples = -9 (This is incorrect as you cannot have a negative number of apples)

The mistake is in the calculation. Since Steven has 79 more apples than Jake, let's first find out how many apples Jake has:

Jake's apples = Steven's apples + 79
Jake's apples = 14 + 79
Jake's apples = 93

Now, let's correctly calculate the number of apples Emily has:

Emily's apples = Steven's apples - 23
Emily's apples = 14 - 23
Emily's apples = -9 (This is still incorrect)

The mistake is that we should be comparing Emily's apples to Jake's apples, not Steven's, since the information given is that Emily has 23 fewer apples than Steven. So, let's correct that:

Emily's apples = Jake's apples - 23
Emily's apples = 93 - 23
Emily's apples = 70

So, Jake has 7 peaches, and Emily has 70 apples.","Steven has 19 peaches and 14 apples. Jake has 19 - 12 = 7 peaches and 14 + 79 = 93 apples. Emily has 2 x 7 = 14 peaches and 19 - 23 = 16 apples. 

Therefore, Jake has 7 peaches and Emily has 16 apples.

After 5 customers from one of the groups leave, the number of customers remaining is 14 - 5 = 9 customers.

The updated groups have sizes of 3, 1, 2, and 4. To find out how many customers are sitting alone, we look for the group size that is equal to 1. According to the given sizes, there is only one group with a size of 1.

Therefore, there is 1 customer sitting alone.","There are 10 customers in total after 5 leave. The new average of customers per table is 10/6 = 1+ 2/3 customers per table.

One.","Let's start by calculating the initial average number of customers per table.

Initially, there are 14 customers in total. Since there are 6 tables, we can calculate the initial average by dividing the total number of customers by the number of tables:

14 customers ÷ 6 tables = 2.33 customers per table (approximately)

Now, let's consider the updated groups after 5 customers from one of the groups leave. The new group sizes are 3, 1, 2, and 4.

The total number of customers in the updated groups is:

3 customers + 1 customer + 2 customers + 4 customers = 10 customers

He spends 7 hours on learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends on learning Chinese compared to the sum of the hours spent on learning English and Spanish, we subtract the sum from the hours spent on Chinese:

7 hours (Chinese) - 10 hours (English + Spanish) = -3 hours

This result indicates that Ryan actually spends 3 hours less on learning Chinese compared to the sum of the hours he spends on learning English and Spanish. However, since the question asks for how many more hours he spends on Chinese, we should consider the absolute value of the difference, which is 3 hours.","Ryan spends 13 hours learning Chinese, which is 7 hours more than the sum of the hours spent on learning English (6 hours) and Spanish (4 hours).

721,"Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 527 chocolate chip cookies and 86 raisin cookies yesterday. Today, she decided to bake cookies in two batches. For the first batch, she used a 3:1 ratio of chocolate chip cookies to raisin cookies and baked a total of 372 cookies. In the second batch, she used a 5:2 ratio of chocolate chip cookies to raisin cookies and baked a total of 490 cookies. After baking, Helen gave away 57 chocolate chip cookies and 18 raisin cookies to her neighbors. How many chocolate chip cookies did Helen have left?","Let's first calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies and raisin cookies Helen baked in the first batch today.

The ratio for the first batch is 3:1, which means for every 3 chocolate chip cookies, there is 1 raisin cookie. The total number of cookies in the first batch is 372. To find out how many of each type she baked, we can divide the total number by the sum of the ratio parts (3 + 1 = 4 parts).

For chocolate chip cookies in the first batch:
\( \frac{3}{4} \times 372 = 279 \) chocolate chip cookies

For raisin cookies in the first batch:
\( \frac{1}{4} \times 372 = 93 \) raisin cookies

Now, let's calculate the number of cookies in the second batch with a 5:2 ratio.

The total number of cookies in the second batch is 490. The sum of the ratio parts is 5 + 2 = 7 parts.

For chocolate chip cookies in the second batch:
\( \frac{5}{7} \times 490 = 350 \) chocolate chip cookies

For raisin cookies in the second batch:
\( \frac{2}{7} \times 490 = 140 \) raisin cookies

Now, let's add up all the chocolate chip cookies Helen baked:

From yesterday: 527
From the first batch today: 279
From the second batch today: 350
Total chocolate chip cookies baked: \( 527 + 279 + 350 = 1156 \)

Helen gave away 57 chocolate chip cookies to her neighbors, so let's subtract those:

Total chocolate chip cookies left: \( 1156 - 57 = 1099 \)

Helen has 1099 chocolate chip cookies left.","Helen started with 527 chocolate chip cookies and 86 raisin cookies. 

For the first batch, she used 3 parts chocolate chip cookies to 1 part raisin cookies, so:
3 x = 527
1 x = 86
Solving for x gives us x = 176. 
The first batch yielded a total of 372 cookies, so Helen has 176 + 86 = 262 chocolate chip cookies left. 

For the second batch, she used 5 parts chocolate chip cookies to 2 parts raisin cookies:
5x = 527
2x = 86
Solving for x gives us x = 86. 
With this batch, Helen produced 490 cookies. After giving some away, she has 527 - 57 = 470 chocolate chip cookies left. 

So in total, Helen has 262 + 470 = **732** chocolate chip cookies remaining.","Let's denote the number of chocolate chip cookies as C and the number of raisin cookies as R.

From the first batch, we know that the ratio of chocolate chip cookies to raisin cookies is 3:1. So we can write this as:
3C = R

From the second batch, we know that the ratio of chocolate chip cookies to raisin cookies is 5:2. So we can write this as:
5C = 2R

We also know that Helen gave away 57 chocolate chip cookies and 18 raisin cookies to her neighbors. So we can write this as:
C - 57 = R - 18

Now we have a system of three equations:
1) 3C = R
2) 5C = 2R
3) C - 57 = R - 18

We can solve this system by expressing R in terms of C from the first two equations and then substituting that expression into the third equation.

From the first equation, we can express R as:
R = 3C

Now we can substitute this expression for R into the second equation:
5C = 2(3C)
5C = 6C

Since C cannot be zero (because Helen baked chocolate chip cookies), we can divide both sides by C to solve for C:
5 = 6

This is not a valid equation, so there is no solution to the system of equations. This means that the information given is not sufficient to determine the number of chocolate chip cookies Helen had left. We need more information about the number of chocolate chip cookies or raisin cookies to solve the problem.",732,insufficient,1099

Fantasy novels sold: 35% of 80 = 0.35 * 80 = 28
Romance novels sold: 50% of 120 = 0.50 * 120 = 60

Now, let's calculate how many books he has left in each genre:

Fantasy novels left: 80 - 28 = 52
Romance novels left: 120 - 60 = 60
Science fiction novels left: 50 (since he didn't sell any)

Finally, let's add up the remaining books from all genres to find out how many books Paul has left in his collection:

Total books left: 52 (fantasy) + 60 (romance) + 50 (science fiction) = 162

Paul has 162 books left in his collection after the garage sale.","Paul's collection breaks down into:
35% x 80 books = 28 books sold from the fantasy section. He has 52 books left.

Half x 120 books = 60 books sold from the romance section. He has 60 books left.

The science fiction section remains unchanged at 50 books.

Then he read a second book with 379 pages which took him 5 days to complete. After, he picked up a third book with 480 pages spending 6 days to finish it. Calculate the average number of pages that Frank read per day over his vacation.","To calculate the average number of pages Frank read per day over his vacation, we need to first find the total number of pages he read and then divide that by the total number of days he spent reading.

Total pages read:
First book: 249 pages
Second book: 379 pages
Third book: 480 pages

Total pages = 249 + 379 + 480
Total pages = 1108 pages

Total days spent reading:

732,"There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 7 orchids and 31 roses in the vase. For every 3 orchids she cut, Jessica also cut 5 roses. How many orchids did she cut?","Let's denote the number of orchids Jessica cut as O and the number of roses she cut as R.

From the information given, we know that the total number of orchids in the vase after Jessica added more is 7. Since there were initially 3 orchids, we can write the following equation:

Initial orchids + Cut orchids = Total orchids
3 + O = 7

Solving for O, we get:
O = 7 - 3
O = 4

So, Jessica cut 4 orchids.

We also know that for every 3 orchids she cut, she also cut 5 roses. Since she cut 4 orchids, we can set up a proportion to find out how many roses she cut:

3 orchids : 5 roses = 4 orchids : R roses

Cross-multiplying to solve for R, we get:
3R = 5 * 4
3R = 20

Dividing both sides by 3 to solve for R, we get:
R = 20 / 3
R = 6.666...

Since Jessica can't cut a fraction of a rose, we need to adjust our numbers. The ratio of 3 orchids to 5 roses means that for every set of 3 orchids, there must be a corresponding set of 5 roses. Since Jessica cut 4 orchids, she must have cut roses in sets of 5. The closest multiple of 5 that is greater than or equal to 6.666... is 10 (since 5 * 2 = 10). This means she cut 2 sets of roses, which corresponds to 2 sets of orchids (2 * 3 = 6 orchids). However, we know she only cut 4 orchids, so our initial calculation was correct, and she indeed cut 4 orchids.

Therefore, Jessica cut 4 orchids.","We know that for every 3 orchids cut, 5 roses are also cut. We can use this information to solve the problem as follows:

1. Start with the same number of orchids and roses after the initial cut:
3 orchids + 5 roses = 8 flowers cut
2. We know that there are now 7 orchids in the vase. We can subtract this number from the total number of orchids after the initial cut:
Orchids after initial cut - New orchids in vase = 3 orchids
3. Now, we'll subtract this number from the total flowers cut to find the number of orchids cut overall:
8 flowers cut - 3 orchids = 5 orchids

Result: 5","Jessica started with 3 orchids and ended up with 7 orchids, so she added 4 more orchids to the vase.

For every 3 orchids she cut, she also cut 5 roses. Since she added 4 more orchids, we can find out how many roses she cut by dividing the number of roses she added by the number of roses she cut for every 3 orchids.

4 (the number of roses added) ÷ 5 (the number of roses cut for every 3 orchids) = 0.8

Since Jessica can't cut a fraction of a rose, we can assume that she cut 0.8 roses, which is close to 1 rose. However, since we are looking for the number of orchids she cut, we can disregard the fraction of a rose and focus on the number of orchids.

Jessica started with 3 orchids and ended up with 7 orchids, so she added 4 more orchids. Since she added 4 more orchids, we can assume that she cut 4 orchids.

If 20 people can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously, find out how many times the single seat, double seat, triple seat, and quadruple seat occur in the cycle to accommodate all riders at once.","Let's denote the number of single seats as \( S \), double seats as \( D \), triple seats as \( T \), and quadruple seats as \( Q \). We know that the seats are arranged cyclically in the order of single, double, triple, and quadruple. 

The total number of people that can be accommodated in the Ferris wheel is given as 20. Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on the capacities of the seats:

\[ S \cdot 1 + D \cdot 2 + T \cdot 3 + Q \cdot 4 = 20 \]

Since the seats are arranged cyclically, we know that the number of each type of seat will be the same. Let's denote this common number as \( x \). Therefore, we have:

\[ S = x \]
\[ D = x \]
\[ T = x \]
\[ Q = x \]

Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\[ x \cdot 1 + x \cdot 2 + x \cdot 3 + x \cdot 4 = 20 \]
\[ x \cdot (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 20 \]
\[ x \cdot 10 = 20 \]
\[ x = 20 / 10 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, there are 2 of each type of seat. This means there are 2 single seats, 2 double seats, 2 triple seats, and 2 quadruple seats. To verify that this accommodates 20 people:

\[ 2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 4 = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20 \]

Thus, the Ferris wheel has 2 single seats, 2 double seats, 2 triple seats, and 2 quadruple seats to accommodate all 20 riders at once.","To solve the problem, we need to ascertain the number of times each seat type appears in the cycle to accommodate 20 people. Let's break it down:
1. Divide 20 by the capacity of the single seat to find the number of single seats in the cycle. 20 / 1 = 20 seats needed.

2. Do the same for the other seat types:
   - 20 / 2 = 10 double seats
   - 20 / 3 = 6.67 (rounded down due to fractions) triple seats
   - 20 / 4 = 5 quadruple seats

3. Now, we'll look for the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. We need the cycle to repeat a whole number of times to fit everyone.
   - The LCM of 20, 10, 6, and 5 is 60.

The final result is 60. 

Twenty people can be accommodated in one complete cycle of the Ferris wheel's 60 seats.","Let's denote the number of times each type of seat occurs in the cycle as follows:

- Single seat: x
- Double seat: y
- Triple seat: z
- Quadruple seat: w

The total number of seats in the Ferris wheel is the sum of the capacities of all the seats:

Total seats = 1 (single seat) + 2 (double seat) + 3 (triple seat) + 4 (quadruple seat)
Total seats = 10

The total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel at once is given as 20. To find out how many times each type of seat occurs in the cycle, we need to set up an equation based on the total number of seats and the total number of people that can ride.

The equation would be:

x + y + z + w = 20

However, we are not given the exact number of people that can ride each type of seat. We only know that the total number of people that can ride is 20. To find out the number of times each type of seat occurs in the cycle, we need to know the capacity of each type of seat.

If we assume that the capacity of the single seat is 1, the capacity of the double seat is 2, the capacity of the triple seat is 3, and the capacity of the quadruple seat is 4, then we can set up the equation:

x + 2y + 3z + 4w = 20

Now, let's solve for x, y, z, and w:

1x + 2y + 3z + 4w = 20

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 1:

x = 20 / 1
x = 20

Now, let's find the value of y by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

y = 20 / 2
y = 10

Next, we find the value of z by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

z = 20 / 3
z = 6.666...

Since we can't have a fraction of a seat, we need to adjust the number of times the triple seat occurs in the cycle. Let's assume that the capacity of the triple seat is 3, which means the triple seat can accommodate 3 people at once. Now, the equation becomes:

1x + 2y + 3z + 4w = 20
1x + 2y + 3z = 17

Now, let's find the value of w by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:",60,5,2

The original price of each pack is $26. With a 15% discount, the amount of the discount is:
15% of $26 = 0.15 * $26 = $3.90

So, the discounted price of each pack before tax is:
$26 - $3.90 = $22.10

Now, we need to calculate the final price of each pack after the 8% sales tax is applied to the discounted price. 

The sales tax amount is:
8% of $22.10 = 0.08 * $22.10 = $1.768

We round the sales tax to the nearest cent, which would be $1.77.

So, the final price of each pack after the discount and sales tax is:
$22.10 + $1.77 = $23.87

Now, let's see how many packs you can buy with $104.

Number of packs = $104 / $23.87

To find out how many whole packs you can buy, we divide $104 by $23.87 and round down to the nearest whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a pack.

Number of packs = 104 / 23.87 ≈ 4.36

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, you can buy 4 packs of DVDs with $104.","Steps: 
1. The discount saves 15% x 26 dollars = 3.9 dollars per pack.

2. The price after discount is 26 - 3.9 = 22.1 dollars. 

3. Sales tax is 8% x 22.1 dollars = 1.77 dollars. 

4. The final price per pack is 22.1 + 1.77 = 23.87 dollars. 

5. Number of packs that can be bought is 104 dollars / 23.87 dollars per pack ≈ 4.36 packs.

Result: 4.","First, let's calculate the discount on each pack of DVDs. Since the discount is 15%, we multiply the original cost of each pack by 0.15 to find the discount amount:

0.15 * 26 = 3.90

26 - 3.90 = 22.10

Next, we need to calculate the sales tax on the discounted price per pack. Since the sales tax is 8%, we multiply the discounted price by 0.08 to find the tax amount:

0.08 * 22.10 = 1.768

739,"During the harvest season, Lewis earns a weekly income that varies depending on his workload. In the first week, he earns $20. In the following weeks, his earnings increase by $2 per week (i.e., he earns $22 in the second week, $24 in the third week, and so on). Additionally, Lewis has to pay $3 in expenses for each week of work. By the end of the harvest season, Lewis has a total saved amount of $595. How many weeks did the harvest season last?","Let's denote the number of weeks Lewis worked during the harvest season as \( n \).

Lewis's earnings start at $20 in the first week and increase by $2 each week. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 \) is $20, and the common difference \( d \) is $2.

The \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \]

Lewis's earnings in the \( n \)-th week would be:
\[ a_n = 20 + (n - 1) \times 2 \]

The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n) \]

Substituting \( a_n \) from the previous equation, we get:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (20 + [20 + (n - 1) \times 2]) \]
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (20 + 20 + 2n - 2) \]
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (38 + 2n - 2) \]
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2n + 36) \]
\[ S_n = n \times (n + 18) \]

However, Lewis also has to pay $3 in expenses for each week of work. So, the total expenses for \( n \) weeks would be \( 3n \).

The total amount saved by Lewis after \( n \) weeks is the total earnings minus the total expenses:
\[ 595 = S_n - 3n \]
\[ 595 = n \times (n + 18) - 3n \]
\[ 595 = n^2 + 18n - 3n \]
\[ 595 = n^2 + 15n \]

Now we have a quadratic equation to solve for \( n \):
\[ n^2 + 15n - 595 = 0 \]

We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Let's try to factor it first.

We need two numbers that multiply to -595 and add up to 15. These numbers are 25 and -23 (because 25 * -23 = -595 and 25 + (-23) = 2).

So we can write the equation as:
\[ (n + 25)(n - 23) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us two possible solutions for \( n \):
\[ n + 25 = 0 \]
\[ n = -25 \] (which is not possible since the number of weeks cannot be negative)

and

\[ n - 23 = 0 \]
\[ n = 23 \]

Therefore, the harvest season lasted for 23 weeks.","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many weeks Lewis worked during the harvest season to reach a total savings of $595. We can start by calculating his weekly earnings, which increase by $2 each week. 

Week 1: $20
Week 2: $20 + $2 = $22
Week 3: $22 + $2 = $24
Week 4: $24 + $2 = $26

Lewis also has weekly expenses of $3 per week. Subtracting these from his earnings:

Week 1: $20 - $3 = $17
Week 2: $22 - $3 = $19
Week 3: $24 - $3 = $21
Week 4: $26 - $3 = $23

Next, we sum up the weekly savings to calculate the total savings over the harvest season:

$17 + $19 + $21 + $23 + ... = $595

We observe that each week the increase in Lewis's earnings is the same as the weekly expenses. This means that the two values cancel each other out when added together. Therefore, we can simply add the weekly savings to determine the number of weeks:

$17 + $19 + $21 + $23 = $70

Since Lewis's savings after the first week was $17, we can divide $70 by $17 to find the number of weeks:

$70 / $17 = 4.12 weeks

The harvest season lasted 4 weeks.

---

**4**","Let's denote the number of weeks the harvest season lasted as \( W \).

In the first week, Lewis earns $20. In the following weeks, his earnings increase by $2 per week, so in the second week, he earns $22, in the third week, he earns $24, and so on.

The total amount Lewis earns in the \( W \) weeks is the sum of his earnings in each week:

\[ 20 + 22 + 24 + \dots + (2W - 2) \]

To find the total amount, we need to calculate the sum of the first \( W \) terms of the arithmetic sequence \( 20, 22, 24, \dots, (2W - 2) \).

The common difference in the sequence is \( 2 \), and the first term is \( 20 \). To find the sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[ S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n) \]

where \( S \) is the sum, \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a_1 \) is the first term, and \( a_n \) is the last term.

In this case, \( S \) is the total amount Lewis earns, \( n \) is \( W \), \( a_1 \) is \( 20 \), and \( a_n \) is \( 2W - 2 \).

\[ S = \frac{W}{2} \times (20 + 2W - 2) \]

\[ S = \frac{W}{2} \times (20 + 2W - 2) \]

\[ S = \frac{W}{2} \times (20 + 2W - 2) \]

\[ S = \frac{W}{2} \times (20 + 2W) \]

\[ S = \frac{W}{2} \times (20 + 2W) \]

\[ S = \frac{W}{2} \times 20 + \frac{W}{2} \times 2W \]

\[ S = 10W + \frac{W^2}{2} \]

Now, we know that Lewis has a total saved amount of $595, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 10W + \frac{W^2}{2} = 595 \]

To solve for \( W \), we first simplify the equation:

\[ 10W + \frac{W",4,11.5,23

If Randy initially had 59 small blocks and 18 large blocks, how many blocks of each size are left after the tower is built?","Randy initially had 59 small blocks. He used 36 of them to build the tower, and his friend Cindy contributed 9 more small blocks. So, the total number of small blocks used for the tower is 36 (used by Randy) + 9 (contributed by Cindy) = 45 small blocks.

To find out how many small blocks are left, we subtract the total number of small blocks used from the initial number of small blocks Randy had:
59 (initial small blocks) - 45 (used for the tower) = 14 small blocks left.

Randy initially had 18 large blocks. He used 14 of them to build the tower. To find out how many large blocks are left, we subtract the number of large blocks used from the initial number of large blocks Randy had:
18 (initial large blocks) - 14 (used for the tower) = 4 large blocks left.

If the bananas are organized into 11 groups, oranges are organized into 103 groups, and apples are organized into 17 groups. What is the size of each group for bananas, oranges, and apples?","To find the size of each group, we need to divide the total number of each fruit by the number of groups they are organized into.

For bananas:
527 bananas ÷ 11 groups = 47.9090909 bananas per group
Since we can't have a fraction of a banana in a group, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 47 bananas per group.

For oranges:
386 oranges ÷ 103 groups = 3.74757281553 oranges per group
Again, we can't have a fraction of an orange in a group, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3 oranges per group.

For apples:
319 apples ÷ 17 groups = 18.7647058824 apples per group
We'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 18 apples per group.

So, the size of each group is 47 bananas, 3 oranges, and 18 apples.","Let's first determine the size of each group for bananas: 527 bananas / 11 groups = 47.909 bananas per group.
For the oranges, we have 386 oranges / 103 groups, which gives us 3.758 oranges per group.
Now for the apples: 319 apples / 17 groups results in 18.764 apples per group.

The final results are 48, 3.76, and 18.76 for bananas, oranges, and apples respectively.

Bananas: 48
Oranges: 3.76
Apples: 18.76","To find the size of each group for bananas, oranges, and apples, we need to divide the total number of each fruit by the number of groups they are organized into.

742,"Bobby ate 28 pieces of candy. Then he ate 42 more, but only ate 3/4 of these. He also ate 63 pieces of chocolate, and decided to consume half of those as well. Considering his total consumption, how many pieces of candy and chocolate did Bobby eat?","First, let's calculate how many of the 42 pieces of candy Bobby ate. Since he ate 3/4 of them:

3/4 * 42 = 31.5 pieces of candy

Now, let's calculate how many of the 63 pieces of chocolate he ate. Since he ate half of them:

1/2 * 63 = 31.5 pieces of chocolate

Now, let's add up all the pieces of candy and chocolate Bobby ate:

28 (initial pieces of candy) + 31.5 (additional pieces of candy) + 31.5 (pieces of chocolate) = 91 pieces

So, Bobby ate a total of 91 pieces of candy and chocolate.","Bobby ate 28 pieces of candy, and then 42 more, making it a total of 70 pieces of candy. But he only ate 3/4 of these, so he ended up eating 52.5 pieces. He also ate 63 pieces of chocolate and consumed half of those, which equates to 31.5 pieces.

743,"A store sells packs of DVDs at a regular price of 107 dollars each. During a sale, the store offers a discount of 106 dollars on each pack for the first 10 packs only. After that, every additional pack costs the regular price. If you have 93 dollars, how many packs of DVDs can you buy considering the limited discount offer and your budget constraint?","First, let's calculate the discounted price for the first 10 packs of DVDs. 

The discount is 106 dollars on each pack, so the sale price for each of the first 10 packs is:
107 dollars (regular price) - 106 dollars (discount) = 1 dollar per pack.

With 93 dollars, you can buy as many of these discounted packs as possible. Since each discounted pack costs 1 dollar, you can buy:
93 dollars / 1 dollar per pack = 93 packs.

However, the discount is only for the first 10 packs. So, you can buy 10 packs at the discounted price of 1 dollar each, which will cost you:
10 packs * 1 dollar per pack = 10 dollars.

After buying 10 packs, you have spent 10 dollars out of your 93 dollars, leaving you with:
93 dollars - 10 dollars = 83 dollars.

Since the discount no longer applies, any additional packs will cost the regular price of 107 dollars each. With 83 dollars remaining, you cannot afford any more packs at the regular price because:
83 dollars < 107 dollars (regular price per pack).

Therefore, with 93 dollars, you can buy a total of 10 packs of DVDs during the sale.","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many packs can be bought within the budget of 93 dollars while considering the discount for the first 10 packs.

1. Calculate the cost of the first 10 packs: 107 dollars - 106 dollars = 1 dollar per pack.

2. Determine the number of packs we can buy within the budget: 93 dollars / 1 dollar per pack = 93 packs.

3. Since we only get a discount for the first 10 packs, we can buy 10 packs in total.

Result: 10.","Let's calculate the discounted price for the first 10 packs and then determine how many packs you can buy with your budget.

The discount offered is 106 dollars per pack for the first 10 packs. So, the discounted price for each of these packs is:

Regular price - Discount = 107 dollars - 106 dollars = 1 dollar

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the first 10 packs at the discounted price:

Total cost for the first 10 packs = 1 dollar/pack * 10 packs = 10 dollars

Now, let's find out how many packs you can buy with your 93 dollars budget, considering the limited discount offer:

Number of packs you can buy = Total budget / (Regular price - Discount)
Number of packs you can buy = 93 dollars / (107 dollars - 106 dollars)
Number of packs you can buy = 93 dollars / 1 dollar
Number of packs you can buy = 93

Jackie's apples - Adam's apples = 43 - 25 = 18

To find out how many more oranges Jackie has than Adam, we subtract the number of oranges Adam has from the number of oranges Jackie has:

Jackie's oranges - Adam's oranges = 29 - 34 = -5

Since the result is negative, it means that Jackie has 5 fewer oranges than Adam.

To find the total number of more apples and oranges Jackie has than Adam, we add the difference in apples to the difference in oranges:

Total more apples and oranges = More apples + More oranges
Total more apples and oranges = 18 + (-5)
Total more apples and oranges = 18 - 5
Total more apples and oranges = 13

Jerseys: 64 jerseys * $5/jersey = $320
T-shirts: 20 t-shirts * $15/t-shirt = $300
Hats: 30 hats * $8/hat = $240
Hoodies: 10 hoodies * $25/hoodie = $250

Now, let's add up these amounts to get the total profit before the discount and vendor fee:

Total profit before discount and vendor fee = $320 + $300 + $240 + $250 = $1110

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The shop offered a 10% discount on the total sales, so we need to find 10% of the total profit before the discount:

Discount = 10% of $1110 = 0.10 * $1110 = $111

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total profit before the discount to get the total profit after the discount:

Total profit after discount = $1110 - $111 = $999

Finally, we need to subtract the vendor fee from the total profit after the discount to get the total profit after the discount and vendor fee:

Total profit after discount and vendor fee = $999 - $50 = $949

So, the Razorback shop made $949 after the discount and vendor fee from selling these items during the game.","Let's calculate the total profits from the sales:
Jerseys: $5/jersey x 64 jerseys = $320

Hoodies: $25/hoodie x 10 hoodies = $250
Total profit before discount: $320 + $300 + $240 + $250 = $1,110

The 10% discount amounts to 1110 x 10/100 = $111.
So, the discount reduced the total profit to $1,110 - $111 = $999.
After subtracting the $50 vendor fee, the Razorback shop made $999 - $50 = $949.

Then, her friend gave her another 31 games, increasing her total to:

If there are a total of 9 chairs in the backyard and there are at least 2 tables with 4 chairs, how many sets of tables with 3 chairs and sets of tables with 4 chairs do they have?","Let's denote the number of sets of tables with 3 chairs as x and the number of sets of tables with 4 chairs as y.

We are given that there are at least 2 sets of tables with 4 chairs, so y ≥ 2.

The total number of chairs is given as 9. Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on the number of chairs:

3x + 4y = 9

Since we know there are at least 2 sets of tables with 4 chairs, let's consider the minimum case where y = 2:

3x + 4(2) = 9
3x + 8 = 9
3x = 9 - 8
3x = 1

However, since x must be a whole number (as you can't have a fraction of a table set), and 1 is not divisible by 3, this does not work. Therefore, we need to consider the next possible value for y, which is y = 3:

3x + 4(3) = 9
3x + 12 = 9
3x = 9 - 12
3x = -3

This also does not work since x cannot be negative.

Since we cannot find a solution with y = 2 or y = 3, and increasing y would only increase the total number of chairs beyond 9, we must conclude that there is a mistake in the problem as stated. It is not possible to have a total of 9 chairs with at least 2 sets of tables with 4 chairs each.","There are 3 sets of tables with 3 chairs and 2 sets of tables with 4 chairs.

To solve, we need to organize the information given:
- 9 chairs in total
- Most sets have 3 chairs, a few have 4
- 2 four-chair sets are among the few with 4 chairs

We know that the total number of chairs is the sum of chairs in three-chair sets and four-chair sets:
9 chairs = 3x chairs in 3-chair sets + 4x chairs in 4-chair sets

Substituting the known values:
9 chairs = 3 × 3 chairs + 4 × 2 chairs

Simplifying:
9 = 9 + 8

The number of three-chair sets is 3, and the number of four-chair sets is 2.

The result is 3 + 2 = 5.","Let's denote the number of sets of tables with 3 chairs as x and the number of sets of tables with 4 chairs as y.

According to the information given, there are at least 2 tables with 4 chairs. This means that y is at least 2.

The total number of chairs in the backyard is 9. Since most sets of tables have 3 chairs, we can assume that most of the chairs are part of sets with 3 chairs. Let's denote the number of chairs in sets with 3 chairs as 3x.

Now, we can set up the equation:

3x + y = 9

We know that y is at least 2, so we can write:

3x + 2 = 9

Now, we can solve for x:

3x = 9 - 2
3x = 7
x = 7 / 3
x = 2.333...

Since we can't have a fraction of a set of tables, we'll round x to the nearest whole number. Since 2.333... is closer to 2 than to 3, we'll round x to 2.

Total received = $8.25 + $6.50 + $12.35 + $5.10
Total received = $32.20

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gwen spent:

Money spent on toy: $4.45
Money spent on snacks: $6.25

Total spent = $4.45 + $6.25
Total spent = $10.70

Now, let's find out how much money Gwen had left after spending on the toy and snacks:

Money remaining = Total received - Total spent
Money remaining = $32.20 - $10.70
Money remaining = $21.50

Gwen then spent an additional 25% of her remaining money on books. Let's calculate how much that is:

25% of $21.50 = 0.25 * $21.50
25% of $21.50 = $5.375

Since we usually don't deal with fractions of a cent, we can round this to the nearest cent, which would be $5.38.

Now, let's find out how much money Gwen had left after buying the books:

Money left after books = Money remaining - Money spent on books
Money left after books = $21.50 - $5.38
Money left after books = $16.12

Finally, let's calculate how much more money Gwen received from her mom than from her dad:

More money from mom = Money from mom - Money from dad
More money from mom = $8.25 - $6.50
More money from mom = $1.75

So, after all transactions, Gwen received $1.75 more from her mom than she did from her dad.","Gwen's earnings:

751,"Nell collects baseball cards. Initially, she traded 45 cards with her friend Sam but received 30 new cards in return. Then, she bought 60 new cards from a card shop. Nell gave 301 of her cards to Jeff and now has 154 cards left. How many baseball cards did Nell have initially, before trading and buying any new cards?","Let's work backwards from the information given:

Nell has 154 cards left after giving 301 to Jeff. So before giving the cards to Jeff, she had:
154 cards (left) + 301 cards (given to Jeff) = 455 cards

Before buying 60 new cards from the card shop, she had:
455 cards (after trading with Sam) - 60 cards (bought) = 395 cards

Before trading with Sam, where she traded 45 cards and received 30 in return, she had:
395 cards (before buying) + (45 cards (traded away) - 30 cards (received)) = 395 + 15 = 410 cards

So, Nell had 410 baseball cards initially before trading and buying any new cards.","Nell had 99 cards initially.

 Nell has 154 cards now, and she gave 301 cards to Jeff. So, before trading and buying new cards, she must have had 154 cards + 301 cards = 455 cards.

She traded 45 cards away in the first instance. So, Nell's initial cards, before any other trades or purchases, were 455 cards - 45 cards = 410 cards.

This can also be solved by adding the cards she traded with Sam and the cards she purchased from the card shop: 45 cards + 60 cards = 105 cards. 

Nell's initial cards = 410 cards.

The final result is four hundred and ten.","Let's denote the number of baseball cards Nell had initially as \( x \).

According to the information given, after trading 45 cards with Sam, she received 30 new cards in return. So, the total number of cards she had after the trade is \( x - 45 + 30 \).

Then, she bought 60 new cards from a card shop, so the total number of cards she had after the purchase is \( x - 45 + 30 + 60 \).

Next, she gave 301 of her cards to Jeff, and after that, she had 154 cards left. So, the total number of cards she had after giving cards to Jeff is \( x - 45 + 30 + 60 - 301 \).

We can set up the equation based on the information given:

\( x - 45 + 30 + 60 - 301 = 154 \)

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\( x - 45 + 30 + 60 - 301 = 154 \)
\( x - 45 + 90 - 301 = 154 \)
\( x - 45 = 154 + 301 \)
\( x - 45 = 455 \)
\( x = 455 + 45 \)
\( x = 500 \)

So, Nell had initially 500 baseball cards before trading and buying any new cards.",410,500,410
752,"Let x be the number of baskets, r be the number of red peaches in each basket, and g be the number of green peaches in each basket. If there are a total of 10x peaches distributed equally among the baskets, and the proportion of red and green peaches varies for each basket, solve the following system of equations to find the value of x:

Total peaches equation: 10x = r*x + g*x

Red peaches equation: 4x = r*x

Green peaches equation: 6x = g*x","We have three equations:

1) Total peaches equation: \( 10x = rx + gx \)
2) Red peaches equation: \( 4x = rx \)
3) Green peaches equation: \( 6x = gx \)

From equation 2, we can solve for r:
\( 4x = rx \)
Divide both sides by x (assuming x is not zero):
\( 4 = r \)

From equation 3, we can solve for g:
\( 6x = gx \)
Divide both sides by x (assuming x is not zero):
\( 6 = g \)

Now we know that r = 4 and g = 6. We can substitute these values into the total peaches equation to find x:

\( 10x = 4x + 6x \)

Combine like terms:
\( 10x = 10x \)

This equation is true for any value of x, which means that the system of equations does not determine a unique value for x. The system is consistent and dependent, and x can be any non-zero number. The key here is that the total number of peaches (10 per basket) is the sum of the red peaches (4 per basket) and the green peaches (6 per basket), which means that the system is in balance for any number of baskets x.","To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:
1. First, let's manipulate the equations to put them in a more standard form. The equation for the total number of peaches is already in a good format, so we'll keep that as-is:
10x = r*x + g*x

2. For the red peaches equation:
4x - x = r*x ⇒ 3x = r*x
Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:
x = r*x / 3

3. For the green peaches:
6x - x = g*x ⇒ 5x = g*x
And dividing both sides by 5:
x = g*x / 5

4. Now, we'll solve for x by equating the values of x we found in the red and green peaches equations:
r*x / 3 = g*x / 5

Multiplying both sides by 3/5, we get:
r*x = g*x

We can see that both equations hold true when r = g.

5. Finally, we can solve for x by plugging this value into the original total peaches equation:
10x = r*x + g*x
10x = 2*x

Solving for x, we find:
x = 5

The number of baskets is indeed **five**.","Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

From the total peaches equation:
10x = r*x + g*x

We can factor out x from both sides:
10 = r + g

Now, let's look at the red peaches equation:
4x = r*x

We can divide both sides by x to solve for r:
4 = r

So, r = 4.

Now, let's look at the green peaches equation:
6x = g*x

We can divide both sides by x to solve for g:
6 = g

So, g = 6.

Now we have the values of r and g, and we can substitute them back into the total peaches equation:
10 = 4 + 6
10 = 10

This confirms that our calculations are correct. However, we still need to find the value of x.

Since we have the values of r and g, we can substitute them back into the total peaches equation:
10x = 4x + 6x
10x = 10x

This equation is true for any value of x, so we cannot determine the value of x from this system of equations alone. We need additional information or constraints to solve for x.",five,x,x

The mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog. The squirrel jumped the average of the grasshopper's and the frog's jumping distances plus 17 inches. The rabbit jumped twice the difference between the squirrel's and the mouse's distances. How far did each animal jump?","Let's calculate the jumping distances step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.

2. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so:
   Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 39 inches
   Frog's jump = 19 inches + 39 inches
   Frog's jump = 58 inches

3. The mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog, so:
   Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 94 inches
   Mouse's jump = 58 inches - 94 inches
   Mouse's jump = -36 inches (This is not possible since a jump cannot be negative. There might be a mistake in the information provided. Let's assume it's a typo and it should be 9 inches less instead of 94 inches less.)
   Corrected Mouse's jump = 58 inches - 9 inches
   Corrected Mouse's jump = 49 inches

4. The squirrel jumped the average of the grasshopper's and the frog's jumping distances plus 17 inches, so:
   Average of Grasshopper's and Frog's jumps = (Grasshopper's jump + Frog's jump) / 2
   Average = (19 inches + 58 inches) / 2
   Average = 77 inches / 2
   Average = 38.5 inches
   Squirrel's jump = Average + 17 inches
   Squirrel's jump = 38.5 inches + 17 inches
   Squirrel's jump = 55.5 inches

5. The rabbit jumped twice the difference between the squirrel's and the mouse's distances, so:
   Difference = Squirrel's jump - Mouse's jump
   Difference = 55.5 inches - 49 inches
   Difference = 6.5 inches
   Rabbit's jump = 2 * Difference
   Rabbit's jump = 2 * 6.5 inches
   Rabbit's jump = 13 inches

So, the jumping distances for each animal are:
- Grasshopper: 19 inches
- Frog: 58 inches
- Mouse: 49 inches (assuming the corrected value)
- Squirrel: 55.5 inches
- Rabbit: 13 inches","Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.

2. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we add 39 inches to the grasshopper's jump: 19 + 39 = 58 inches.

3. The mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog, so we subtract 94 inches from the frog's jump: 58 - 94 = 36 inches.

4. The squirrel jumped the average of the grasshopper's and the frog's jumps plus 17 inches. The average of 19 and 58 is (19 + 58) / 2 = 39 inches. Adding 17 inches to the average gives us 39 + 17 = 56 inches.

5. The rabbit jumped twice the difference between the squirrel's and the mouse's jumps. The difference between the squirrel's and mouse's jumps is 56 - 36 = 20 inches. Twice this value is 2 x 20 = 40 inches.

6. The final results are:

- Grasshopper: 19 inches
- Frog: 58 inches
- Mouse: 36 inches
- Squirrel: 56 inches
- Rabbit: 40 inches

Hop!","Let's denote the grasshopper's jump as G, the frog's jump as F, the mouse's jump as M, the squirrel's jump as S, and the rabbit's jump as R.

According to the information given:

G = 19 inches
F = G + 39 inches = 19 + 39 = 58 inches
M = F - 94 inches = 58 - 94 = -36 inches
S = (G + F) / 2 + 17 inches = (19 + 58) / 2 + 17 = 77 / 2 + 17 = 43.5 + 17 = 60.5 inches
R = 2 * (S - M) = 2 * (60.5 - (-36)) = 2 * (60.5 + 36) = 2 * 96.5 = 193 inches

Now we have the jumping distances for each animal:

G = 19 inches
F = 58 inches
M = -36 inches
S = 60.5 inches
R = 193 inches

763,"A farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden. He picked 56 of them on the first day, and 41 on the second day. However, the tomato plants produce new tomatoes every day. On the first day, 20 new tomatoes grew, and on the second day, 30 new tomatoes grew. If the farmer picked an unknown number of tomatoes on the third day, and 25 new tomatoes grew on the third day, how many tomatoes are left in the garden after the third day?","Let's calculate the number of tomatoes left after the first day:

Tomatoes at the start: 160
Tomatoes picked on the first day: -56
New tomatoes grown on the first day: +20

Total after the first day: 160 - 56 + 20 = 124 tomatoes

Now, let's calculate the number of tomatoes left after the second day:

Tomatoes after the first day: 124
Tomatoes picked on the second day: -41
New tomatoes grown on the second day: +30

Total after the second day: 124 - 41 + 30 = 113 tomatoes

Let's denote the unknown number of tomatoes picked on the third day as x. After the third day, the number of tomatoes left will be:

Tomatoes after the second day: 113
Tomatoes picked on the third day: -x
New tomatoes grown on the third day: +25

Total after the third day: 113 - x + 25

To find out how many tomatoes are left after the third day, we need to know the value of x (the number of tomatoes picked on the third day). Without this information, we can only express the total number of tomatoes left as an equation:

Total after the third day = 113 - x + 25

Simplifying the equation:

Total after the third day = 138 - x

Without the value of x, we cannot determine the exact number of tomatoes left in the garden after the third day.","The farmer started with 160 tomatoes.

He picked 56 on day 1, so 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left.

On day 1, 20 new tomatoes grew, so 104 + 20 = 124 tomatoes after day 1.

He picked 41 tomatoes on day 2, so 124 - 41 = 83 tomatoes left.

Another 30 new tomatoes grew on day 2, so 83 + 30 = 113 tomatoes after day 2.

On day 3, 25 new tomatoes grew. If an unknown number was picked by the farmer, we cannot calculate the exact number of tomatoes left. 

However, we know that there were at least 83 tomatoes left after the third day, as this is the minimum number of tomatoes left after the second day, taking into account the new growth and unknown pickings.

**83**","After the first day, the farmer had 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left.

After the second day, the farmer had 104 - 41 = 63 tomatoes left.

On the second day, 30 new tomatoes grew, so the total number of tomatoes after the second day was 63 + 30 = 93 tomatoes.

On the third day, 25 new tomatoes grew, so the total number of tomatoes after the third day was 93 + 25 = 118 tomatoes.

The farmer picked an unknown number of tomatoes on the third day, so we need to find out how many tomatoes were left after the third day.

Let's call the number of tomatoes picked on the third day x.

After the third day, the total number of tomatoes left would be 118 - x.

We know that 25 new tomatoes grew on the third day, so the total number of tomatoes after the third day would be 118 + 25 = 143 tomatoes.

Therefore, the number of tomatoes left after the third day is 143 - x.

Original number of red peaches in one basket: 19
After removing 3 red peaches: 19 - 3 = 16 red peaches

Original number of green peaches in one basket: 4
After removing 1 green peach: 4 - 1 = 3 green peaches

The number of moldy peaches remains the same since the shopkeeper didn't remove any: 6 moldy peaches

Now, the shopkeeper adds 5 freshly harvested peaches to each basket. So, the total number of peaches added to each basket is 5.

Total peaches in one basket after adjustments:
Red peaches: 16
Green peaches: 3
Moldy peaches: 6
Freshly harvested peaches: 5

Total peaches in one basket = 16 + 3 + 6 + 5 = 30 peaches

Now, there are 15 baskets, so we multiply the total number of peaches in one basket by the number of baskets:

15 x (4 - 1) = 15 x 3 = 45 (green peaches)

Adding 5 freshly harvested peaches to each basket:
240 + 5 x 15 = 270 (red peaches)
45 + 5 x 15 = 75 (green peaches)

For the first wall:
96 nails / 6 nails per plank = 16 planks

For the second wall:
120 nails / 6 nails per plank = 20 planks

For the third wall:
84 nails / 6 nails per plank = 14 planks

For the fourth wall:
102 nails / 6 nails per plank = 17 planks

The number of nails required to secure all the planks for one wall is 96 + 120 + 84 + 102 = 402. Since each plank requires 6 nails, 402 nails are needed to assemble all the planks for one wall, which means that a division by 6 is required: 402 / 6 = 67. So, John needs 67 x 4 = 268 planks in total for all the walls. As we need the number of planks per wall, we divide the total by the number of walls: 268 / 4 = 67.

How many minutes did the machine work today to produce both shirts and pants?,"To calculate the total time the machine worked today, we need to find out the time it took to produce the shirts and the time it took to produce the pants, then add them together.

For shirts:
The machine produced 40 shirts today.
It produces shirts at a rate of 5 shirts per minute.
So, the time taken to produce shirts today is 40 shirts / 5 shirts per minute = 8 minutes.

For pants:
The machine produced 50 pants today.
It produces pants at a rate of 3 pants per minute.
So, the time taken to produce pants today is 50 pants / 3 pants per minute = 16.67 minutes.

Now, we add the time for shirts and pants to get the total time the machine worked today:
Total time = Time for shirts + Time for pants
Total time = 8 minutes + 16.67 minutes
Total time = 24.67 minutes

Therefore, the machine worked for approximately 24.67 minutes today to produce both shirts and pants.","The machine worked for 14 minutes today.

We know that the machine can produce 5 shirts per minute and 3 pants per minute. We can thus calculate the time needed to produce the specified number of shirts and pants.

The shirts take 40 / 5 = 8 minutes to produce.
The pants take 50 / 3 = 16.66 minutes, which we will round up to 17 minutes. 

Together, the machine worked 8 + 17 = **14 minutes**.","To find out how many minutes the machine worked today, we first need to calculate the total number of shirts and pants produced today and then divide that by the production rate for each type of garment.

Today, the machine produced 40 shirts and 50 pants.

40 shirts ÷ 5 shirts per minute = 8 minutes

The production rate for pants is 3 pants per minute, so to find out how many minutes it took to produce the pants, we divide the total number of pants by the production rate:

50 pants ÷ 3 pants per minute = 16.67 minutes

Since the machine can't produce a fraction of a minute, we'll round up to the nearest whole minute. Therefore, the machine worked 17 minutes to produce the pants.

The mailman gives out 16 pieces of mail to each house but skips every third house. This means that for every set of three houses, two houses receive mail and one does not. 

To find out how many sets of three houses there are, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail for a block by the number of pieces each house receives:

128 pieces of mail / 16 pieces per house = 8 houses that receive mail

Since these 8 houses are the ones that receive mail in the pattern of two houses receiving mail and one being skipped, we can calculate the total number of houses in a block by considering the pattern:

For every 2 houses that receive mail, there is 1 house that is skipped. So for 8 houses that receive mail, we can set up the equation:

2 houses receive mail + 1 house skipped = 3 houses (this is one set)

Now we need to find out how many sets of 3 houses there are to make up the 8 houses that receive mail:

8 houses that receive mail / 2 houses per set = 4 sets

Since each set consists of 3 houses (2 that receive mail and 1 that is skipped), we multiply the number of sets by 3 to get the total number of houses:

4 sets * 3 houses per set = 12 houses in a block

So, there are 12 houses in a block.","Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that the mailman gives 16 mails to each house in a block. Since every third house is skipped, we can assume that out of every three houses, only two are given mails. Therefore, the number of houses in a block must be divisible by 3.

128 pieces of junk mail are distributed to each block. Since the mailman gives 16 mails to each house (two mails for every three houses), 128 mails correspond to 8 blocks of houses: 128 / 16 = 8.

Now we know that the number of houses in a block is three times the number of houses per block wall. If there are x houses in a block, then there are 3x houses in total in each block of houses. So we get:

3x = 8
x = 8 / 3
x = 2 1/3, or 2.67 houses per block wall.

The number of houses in one full block is:
2.67 × 3 = 8.01 ≈ 8 houses.

Therefore, the final result is: **eight**.","First, let's find out how many pieces of junk mail the mailman has to distribute to each house in a block. Since he gives 16 mails to each house and skips every third house, we can calculate the number of houses in a block by dividing the total number of mails by the number of mails per house and then multiplying by the number of houses per block.

Total number of mails per block = 128
Number of mails per house = 16
Number of houses per block = 85

Number of houses in a block = (Total number of mails per block / Number of mails per house) * Number of houses per block
Number of houses in a block = (128 / 16) * 85
Number of houses in a block = 8 * 85
Number of houses in a block = 680

Now, we know that there are 680 houses in a block, and the mailman skips every third house. To find out how many houses are skipped, we divide the total number of houses by 3.

Number of houses skipped = Total number of houses / 3
Number of houses skipped = 680 / 3
Number of houses skipped = 226.666...

Since we can't have a fraction of a house, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. This means that the mailman skips 226 houses in each block.

Now, let's find out how many houses are not skipped, which means they receive the junk mail.

Number of houses not skipped = Total number of houses - Number of houses skipped
Number of houses not skipped = 680 - 226
Number of houses not skipped = 454

Now we know that there are 454 houses in each block that receive the junk mail. To find out how many houses there are in total, we multiply the number of houses not skipped by the number of blocks.

Total number of houses = Number of houses not skipped * Number of blocks

Now, Matthew has 24 - 4 = 20 crackers left.

He then distributes these 20 crackers equally among his 3 other friends. To find out how many crackers each of the 3 friends received, we divide the remaining crackers by 3:

20 crackers / 3 friends = 6.666... crackers per friend

Since Matthew can't give away a fraction of a cracker, we'll assume each friend received 6 crackers, and there would be 2 crackers left over that are not distributed.","Matthew gave 20% of his crackers away, leaving him with 80% or 19.2 crackers. 
When divided equally among his three friends, they each receive 6.4 crackers. 

Six point four.","First, let's calculate how many crackers Matthew gave away to his friend:

20% of 24 crackers = 0.20 * 24 = 4.8

Since you can't give away a fraction of a cracker, we'll assume he gave away the whole 5 crackers (since 4.8 is close to 5).

Now, let's find out how many crackers are left for the other 3 friends:

24 crackers - 5 crackers = 19 crackers

Now, we divide the remaining 19 crackers equally among the 3 friends:

19 crackers ÷ 3 friends = 6.33

775,"There are 25 different books and 45 different movies in the 'Crazy Silly School' series. A bookstore has a special offer in which you can buy a bundle consisting of 3 books and 7 movies. 

If you want to buy all the books and movies in the series using the special bundles, how many more complete bundles do you need to buy focusing on purchasing movies than the ones you need to complete the book collection?","First, let's calculate how many bundles you would need to buy to get all the books and all the movies.

For the books:
There are 25 books in the series, and each bundle contains 3 books. To find out how many bundles you need to buy to get all the books, you divide the total number of books by the number of books in each bundle:

25 books ÷ 3 books/bundle = 8.3333 bundles

Since you can't buy a fraction of a bundle, you would need to buy 9 bundles to get all the books. This would give you 27 books, which is 2 more than the 25 you need, but it's the minimum number of bundles you can buy to get all the books.

For the movies:
There are 45 movies in the series, and each bundle contains 7 movies. To find out how many bundles you need to buy to get all the movies, you divide the total number of movies by the number of movies in each bundle:

45 movies ÷ 7 movies/bundle = 6.4286 bundles

Again, you can't buy a fraction of a bundle, so you would need to buy 7 bundles to get all the movies. This would give you 49 movies, which is 4 more than the 45 you need, but it's the minimum number of bundles you can buy to get all the movies.

Now, let's compare the number of bundles needed for each:

- Books: 9 bundles
- Movies: 7 bundles

To find out how many more complete bundles you need to buy focusing on purchasing movies than the ones you need to complete the book collection, you subtract the number of bundles needed for books from the number of bundles needed for movies:

7 bundles (movies) - 9 bundles (books) = -2 bundles

Since you can't have a negative number of bundles, this means you actually need 2 fewer bundles for movies than for books, not more. So, you don't need any additional bundles focusing on purchasing movies; instead, you need 2 more bundles to complete the book collection than you do for the movie collection.","To solve the problem, we must determine how many bundles are needed to get the total number of movies required and then compare it with the number of bundles required for the book collection. 

The number of movies in the series is 45, and each bundle gives us 7 movies, so we divide the larger number by the smaller one: 45 ÷ 7 = 6.33. 

The number of books in the series is 25, and each bundle has 3 books, so we divide the larger by the smaller: 25 ÷ 3 = 8.33. 

As we can't buy partial bundles, we round up both values to the next whole number: 7 and 9. 

We now subtract the number of movie bundles needed to complete the collection from the number of book bundles: 9 - 7 = 2. 

The final result is 2.","First, let's find out how many complete bundles of books and movies you need to buy to complete the book collection.

There are 25 different books in the series. To buy all the books, you would need to buy 25 / 3 = 8.333... complete bundles of books. Since you can't buy a fraction of a bundle, you would need to buy 9 complete bundles of books to complete the book collection.

Now, let's find out how many complete bundles of movies you need to buy to complete the movie collection.

There are 45 different movies in the series. To buy all the movies, you would need to buy 45 / 7 = 6.428... complete bundles of movies. Since you can't buy a fraction of a bundle, you would need to buy 7 complete bundles of movies to complete the movie collection.

Now, let's compare the number of complete bundles of movies you need to buy to complete the movie collection with the number of complete bundles of books you need to buy to complete the book collection.

The difference between the number of complete bundles of movies you need to buy and the number of complete bundles of books you need to buy is:

7 (complete bundles of movies) - 9 (complete bundles of books) = -2

This means you need 2 more complete bundles of movies than the ones you need to complete the book collection.",Two.,2,2

Now, let's find out how many books Paul had after selling the books during the garage sale:

220.8 (books after giving to friend) - 130 (books sold during garage sale) = 90.8 books

However, we are told that Paul had 112.3 books left after all transactions. This means that there is a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the steps.

We know that Paul had 284.5 books initially and ended up with 112.3 books. Let's calculate the total number of books that were removed from his collection (given to a friend and sold during the garage sale):

284.5 (initial number of books) - 112.3 (final number of books) = 172.2 books

A 20% rot rate means 20% of 96 red peaches are rotten, which equates to 0.20 x 96 = 19.2 peaches that need to be discarded. The number of good red peaches left is 96 - 19.2 = 76.8.

The final result is 77.

77","First, let's find out how many red and green peaches are rotten and must be discarded.

For the red peaches:
20% of the red peaches are rotten, so we calculate 20% of 16:
0.20 * 16 = 3.2

Since we can't have a fraction of a peach, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 3.

For the green peaches:
15% of the green peaches are rotten, so we calculate 15% of 18:
0.15 * 18 = 2.7

Again, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 3.

Now, let's find out how many good red peaches are left in the baskets in total.

For each basket, there are 16 red peaches, and 3 of them are rotten, so there are 16 - 3 = 13 good red peaches left in each basket.

Since there are 6 baskets, we multiply the number of good red peaches per basket by the number of baskets:
13 * 6 = 78

So, there are 78 good red peaches left in the baskets in total.",77,78,seventy seven

How many roses, orchids, and lilies did she cut from her garden?","To find out how many of each type of flower Jessica cut from her garden, we need to subtract the original number of flowers from the new number of flowers in the vase.

For roses:
Originally, there were 12 roses in the vase. Now there are 10 roses. Since the number of roses has decreased, it means Jessica did not cut any more roses from her garden. In fact, 2 roses were removed from the vase (12 - 10 = 2).

For orchids:
Originally, there were 2 orchids in the vase. Now there are 21 orchids. This means Jessica cut additional orchids from her garden. To find out how many, we subtract the original number from the new number: 21 - 2 = 19 orchids.

For lilies:
Originally, there were 5 lilies in the vase. Now there are 15 lilies. This means Jessica cut additional lilies from her garden. To find out how many, we subtract the original number from the new number: 15 - 5 = 10 lilies.

So, Jessica cut 0 roses, 19 orchids, and 10 lilies from her garden.","We need to find how many flowers Jessica cut from her garden. We can subtract the initial number of flowers from the current number to find the answer:

1. Start: 12 roses, 2 orchids, 5 lilies
2. End: 10 roses + 21 orchids + 15 lilies = 46 flowers

For roses:
12 (before cutting) - 10 (after cutting) = 2 roses cut

For orchids:
2 (before cutting) - 21 (after cutting) = 19 orchids cut

To find out how many more trees survived than died, we compare the number of trees that survived to the number that died:

83 trees (survived) - 84 trees (died) = -1

During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 50 type A jerseys, 35 type B jerseys, 25 type C jerseys, 80 type X t-shirts, and 97 type Y t-shirts. What is the weighted average revenue difference between the t-shirts and jerseys sold?","To find the weighted average revenue difference between the t-shirts and jerseys sold, we first need to calculate the total revenue from each type of item and then find the average revenue per item. After that, we can find the difference between the average revenues of the t-shirts and jerseys.

First, let's calculate the total revenue for each type of jersey and t-shirt:

Type A jersey revenue: 50 jerseys * $180/jersey = $9,000
Type B jersey revenue: 35 jerseys * $210/jersey = $7,350
Type C jersey revenue: 25 jerseys * $220/jersey = $5,500

Total jersey revenue: $9,000 + $7,350 + $5,500 = $21,850

Type X t-shirt revenue: 80 t-shirts * $240/t-shirt = $19,200
Type Y t-shirt revenue: 97 t-shirts * $270/t-shirt = $26,190

Total t-shirt revenue: $19,200 + $26,190 = $45,390

Next, we calculate the total number of jerseys and t-shirts sold:

Total jerseys sold: 50 + 35 + 25 = 110 jerseys
Total t-shirts sold: 80 + 97 = 177 t-shirts

Now, we find the average revenue per jersey and per t-shirt:

Average jersey revenue: $21,850 / 110 jerseys = $198.64/jersey
Average t-shirt revenue: $45,390 / 177 t-shirts = $256.44/t-shirt

Finally, we calculate the weighted average revenue difference between the t-shirts and jerseys:

Weighted average revenue difference = Average t-shirt revenue - Average jersey revenue
Weighted average revenue difference = $256.44 - $198.64 = $57.80

The weighted average revenue difference between the t-shirts and jerseys sold is $57.80.","Let's calculate the revenue from each item first:
Jerseys:
- Type A: $180 x 50 = $9000
- Type B: $210 x 35 = $7350

T-shirts:
- Type X: $240 x 80 = $19,200
- Type Y: $270 x 97 = $26,190

The total revenue from jerseys is $9000 + $7350 + $5500 = $21,850. The total revenue from t-shirts is $19,200 + $26,190 = $45,390.

Now, let's calculate the weighted average revenue difference between the two types of items:
Jerseys average revenue: $21,850 / 100 = $218.50
T-shirts average revenue: $45,390 / 172 = $264.42

- Type Y t-shirts: 97 t-shirts * $270/t-shirt = $26190

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from all jerseys and t-shirts:

- Total revenue from jerseys: $9000 (Type A) + $7350 (Type B) + $5500 (Type C) = $21850
- Total revenue from t-shirts: $19200 (Type X) + $26190 (Type Y) = $45390

Large seats have a weight limit of 1500 lbs each and the average weight of each person riding the Ferris wheel, regardless of their age group or size, is 180 lbs. Assuming that the weight of each person riding the Ferris wheel is equal to the average weight, how many people can ride the Ferris wheel on large seats without violating the weight limit?","To find out how many people can ride the Ferris wheel on large seats without violating the weight limit, we need to calculate the maximum weight each large seat can hold and then determine how many people of the average weight can fit within that limit.

The weight limit for each large seat is 1500 lbs.

The average weight of each person is 180 lbs.

To find out how many people can fit in one large seat without exceeding the weight limit, we divide the weight limit of the seat by the average weight of a person:

1500 lbs (weight limit per large seat) / 180 lbs (average weight per person) = 8.3333...

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So, each large seat can hold 8 people without exceeding the weight limit.

Now, there are 7 large seats on the Ferris wheel. To find the total number of people that can ride on all the large seats, we multiply the number of people per large seat by the number of large seats:

8 people (per large seat) * 7 large seats = 56 people

Therefore, 56 people can ride the Ferris wheel on large seats without violating the weight limit.","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the maximum weight a large seat can hold:
12 people x 180 lbs = 2160 lbs
Since this is below the weight limit of 15000 lbs, we can conclude that a large seat can hold up to 12 people without violating the weight limit.

The final result is 12.","First, let's calculate the total weight capacity of the large seats:

There are 7 large seats, and each large seat can hold 12 people. So, the total number of people that can ride on the large seats is:

7 large seats * 12 people per large seat = 84 people

Now, let's calculate the total weight of these 84 people:

The average weight of each person is 180 lbs, so the total weight of 84 people would be:

84 people * 180 lbs per person = 15,120 lbs

Now, let's check if this total weight violates the weight limit of 1500 lbs per large seat:

15,120 lbs / 7 large seats = 2,160 lbs per large seat

He spends 2 hours more on English than he does on Chinese, so he spends:
5 hours (Chinese) + 2 hours = 7 hours on English.

He spends half the time he does on English learning Spanish, so he spends:
7 hours (English) / 2 = 3.5 hours on Spanish.

He spends a third of the time he does on Spanish learning French, so he spends:

The total time spent on learning these three languages is 13.33 hours.
 
Therefore, the final result is 13 hours.","Let's denote the time Ryan spends on English as E, on Spanish as S, and on French as F.

Since he read the same number of pages each day on days 2 to 8, the total number of pages he read on these days is 7P.

On the first and ninth day, he read a total of 235 pages. Let's denote the number of pages he read on the ninth day as x. Therefore, on the first day, he read 2x pages (since he spent twice as much time reading on the first day as he did on the ninth day).

So, the total number of pages he read on the first and ninth day is x + 2x = 3x, and we know that 3x = 235.

Now we can solve for x:
3x = 235
x = 235 / 3
x = 78.333...

Since the number of pages must be a whole number, we can round down to 78 pages on the ninth day (since it's not possible to read a fraction of a page). This means he read 156 pages on the first day (twice the amount of the ninth day).

Now we can calculate the total number of pages he read on days 2 to 8:
Total pages in the book = 935 pages
Pages read on day 1 and day 9 = 156 + 78 = 234 pages

So the pages read on days 2 to 8 = Total pages - Pages read on day 1 and day 9
Pages read on days 2 to 8 = 935 - 234
Pages read on days 2 to 8 = 701 pages

Since he read the same number of pages each day on days 2 to 8:
P = Pages read on days 2 to 8 / 7
P = 701 / 7
P = 100.142857...

Since he can't read a fraction of a page, we'll consider that he read 100 pages per day on days 2 to 8.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that the first day's reading time is twice that of the ninth day, and both of their page counts sum up to 235 pages. We can call this value x. This means that Frank read 2x pages on the first day and x pages on the ninth day.

2. Since the question mentions that Frank read the same number of pages each day, the sum of all pages read on days 2 to 8 will be the remaining pages after subtracting the first and ninth days' pages from the total number of pages in the book.

3. We're told that the book has 935 pages in total. Subtracting the sum of the first and ninth days' readings (2x + x = 3x) from this gives us the remaining pages, which is 935 - 3x.

4. Now, we can find the number of pages Frank read per day for days 2 to 8 by dividing this total remaining pages by the number of days left (8 days): (935 - 3x) / 8. 

Frank read 116 pages per day on days 2 to 8.

The final result is: 116.","Let's denote the number of pages Frank read per day as P. Since he read the same number of pages each day, we can express the total number of pages he read on the first and the ninth day as 2 * P.

According to the problem, the total number of pages he read on the first and the ninth day is 235. So we can write:

2 * P = 235

Now, we can solve for P:

P = 235 / 2
P = 117.5

Since Frank can't read a fraction of a page, we can round P to the nearest whole number. Since 117.5 is closer to 118 than to 117, we'll round P to 118.

Now, we know that Frank read 118 pages per day on the first and the ninth day. To find out how many pages he read per day on days 2 to 8, we need to subtract the total number of pages he read on the first and the ninth day from the total number of pages in the book:

935 (total pages) - 235 (pages on first and ninth day) = 700 pages

Now, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left (8 days, because we've already accounted for the first and the ninth day):

700 pages / 8 days = 87.5 pages per day

First, let's calculate the number of pages Frank reads in a week:

On weekdays (Monday to Friday), he reads 5.7 pages per day. So in 5 days, he reads:
5.7 pages/day * 5 days = 28.5 pages

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he reads 9.5 pages per day. So in 2 days, he reads:
9.5 pages/day * 2 days = 19 pages

In one week, Frank reads a total of:
28.5 pages (weekdays) + 19 pages (weekends) = 47.5 pages

Now, let's calculate how many full weeks it takes him to read the entire book:

576 pages / 47.5 pages/week = 12.12631579 weeks

Since he can't read a fraction of a week, we'll need to round down to the nearest whole number to find out how many full weeks he reads, which is 12 weeks.

In 12 weeks, he reads:
12 weeks * 47.5 pages/week = 570 pages

After 12 weeks, he has read 570 pages, which leaves him with:
576 pages - 570 pages = 6 pages left to read

Now, we need to calculate how many additional days it takes him to read the remaining 6 pages. Since the last day of the 12th week is a Sunday, the next day is a Monday, and he reads 5.7 pages per day on weekdays. He will finish the remaining 6 pages in one more day.

Therefore, the total number of days Frank took to finish the book is:
12 weeks * 7 days/week + 1 day = 84 days + 1 day = 85 days

Frank took 85 days to finish the book.","Frank read 5.7 x 5 = 28.5 pages per week. So, he needed 576 / 28.5 = 20 weeks to finish the book. 
He could finish the book in 20 weeks x 7 days = 140 days.
140 days.","To find out how many days it took Frank to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages he read each week and then divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he read each week.

On weekdays, he read 5.7 pages per day, so in one week (Monday to Friday), he read:
5.7 pages/day * 5 days/week = 28.5 pages/week

On weekends, he read 9.5 pages per day, so in one week (Saturday and Sunday), he read:
9.5 pages/day * 2 days/week = 19 pages/week

Now, let's add the pages he read on weekdays and weekends to get the total pages read each week:
28.5 pages/week (weekdays) + 19 pages/week (weekends) = 47.5 pages/week

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he read in the book:
47.5 pages/week * 52 weeks/year = 2472 pages

Since the book has 576 pages, we can divide the total number of pages he read by the number of pages in the book to find out how many weeks it took him to finish the book:
2472 pages (total pages read) / 576 pages (total pages in the book) = 4.3 weeks

796,"Brenda's mother is baking cookies for a party. For the party, she expects 10 guests, but 9 guests inform her that they won't make it. She had planned on baking 4 types of cookies - chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, sugar, and peanut butter cookies. 

The total amount of cookies she planned to prepare was 180. Since only one guest will be able to attend, she wants to reduce the quantity but ensure that every type of cookie is included and the guest is not consuming too many of a certain type due to dietary restrictions.

If she evenly distributes the cookies by type and ensures that the guest will not receive more than 20% of any cookie type, how many cookies will she need to make of each type?","If Brenda's mother wants to ensure that the guest will not consume more than 20% of any cookie type, she needs to make sure that the total number of cookies is such that 20% of the total is a whole number, as you can't make a fraction of a cookie.

Let's first find out what 20% of the original plan of 180 cookies is:

20% of 180 = 0.20 * 180 = 36 cookies

This means that originally, the guest could have had up to 36 cookies of each type without exceeding 20% of that type. However, since there will now be only one guest, Brenda's mother wants to reduce the quantity.

If we want to keep the distribution even across the 4 types of cookies, we need to find a total number of cookies that when divided by 4 results in a whole number, and 20% of that total is also a whole number.

Let's start by finding 20% of a smaller number of cookies that is divisible by 4. We can start with the smallest number that meets these criteria, which is 20 (since 20% of 20 is 4, and 4 is divisible by 4). However, since there are 4 types of cookies, this would mean only 1 cookie of each type, which is probably too few.

Let's try the next number that is divisible by 4 and see if 20% of it is a whole number:

20% of 40 = 0.20 * 40 = 8 cookies (2 of each type)
20% of 60 = 0.20 * 60 = 12 cookies (3 of each type)
20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16 cookies (4 of each type)

We can keep going until we find a suitable number that seems like a reasonable amount for one guest. Let's try 100:

20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 cookies (5 of each type)

This seems like a reasonable amount for one guest, with 5 cookies of each type, and it meets the requirement that no more than 20% of any type of cookie is given to the guest. So Brenda's mother should make 5 cookies of each type, for a total of 20 cookies.","Brenda's mother should bake 15 cookies of each type.
15","First, let's find out how many cookies Brenda's mother planned to make of each type. Since she planned to make a total of 180 cookies and she has 4 types of cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of types to find out how many cookies of each type she planned to make.

180 cookies ÷ 4 types = 45 cookies per type

Now, let's find out how many cookies the guest can consume of each type without exceeding the 20% limit. Since the guest will consume 20% of each type, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of cookies of each type by 0.20.

For chocolate chip cookies:
45 cookies × 0.20 = 9 cookies

For oatmeal raisin cookies:
45 cookies × 0.20 = 9 cookies

For sugar cookies:
45 cookies × 0.20 = 9 cookies

For peanut butter cookies:
45 cookies × 0.20 = 9 cookies

Now, let's add up the number of cookies the guest can consume of each type to find the total number of cookies the guest can consume.

9 cookies (chocolate chip) + 9 cookies (oatmeal raisin) + 9 cookies (sugar) + 9 cookies (peanut butter) = 36 cookies

Since Brenda's mother wants to reduce the quantity of cookies but still include every type, we can subtract the number of cookies the guest can consume from the original number of cookies per type to find out how many cookies she needs to make of each type.

For chocolate chip cookies:
45 cookies - 9 cookies = 36 cookies

For oatmeal raisin cookies:
45 cookies - 9 cookies = 36 cookies

For sugar cookies:
45 cookies - 9 cookies = 36 cookies

For peanut butter cookies:
45 cookies - 9 cookies = 36 cookies

Now, let's add up the number of cookies she needs to make of each type to find the total number of cookies she needs to make.

36 cookies (chocolate chip) + 36 cookies (oatmeal raisin) + 36 cookies (sugar) + 36 cookies (peanut butter) = 144 cookies

Since Brenda's mother planned to make 180 cookies in total, we can subtract the total number of cookies the guest can consume from the original total to find out how many cookies she needs to make for the remaining guests.

180 cookies - 36 cookies (guest's consumption) = 144 cookies

Now, let's divide the number of cookies she needs to make for the remaining guests by the number of types",15,144,twenty cookies

How many more storks than all other bird species combined are sitting on the fence now?","Let's calculate the number of each bird species on the fence step by step.

Initial numbers:
- Sparrows: 2
- Crows: 1
- Storks: 3

After more birds arrived:
- Egrets: 4
- Crows: 1 (initial) + 3 (arrived) = 4
- Storks: 3 (initial) + 6 (arrived) = 9
- Sparrows: 2 (initial) + 1 (arrived) = 3

After 15 minutes, some birds left:
- Sparrows: 3 (after arrival) - 2 (left) = 1
- Egrets: 4 (after arrival) - 1 (left) = 3
- Crows: 4 (no change)
- Storks: 9 (no change)

After 30 more minutes, additional birds arrived:
- Storks: 9 (after 15 minutes) + 3 (arrived) = 12
- Crows: 4 (after 15 minutes) + 4 (arrived) = 8

- Sparrows: 1
- Crows: 8
- Egrets: 3

Total other birds = 1 (sparrows) + 8 (crows) + 3 (egrets) = 12

Now we have:
- Storks: 12
- Other birds combined: 12

The number of storks is equal to the number of all other bird species combined, so there are not more storks than all other bird species combined. The difference is 0.","There were initially 2 sparrows + 1 crow + 3 storks = 6 birds on the fence. Then, 4 egrets + 3 crows + 6 storks + 1 sparrow = 14 more birds arrived.

Later, 3 storks and 4 crows = 7 more birds arrived.
In total, there are now 17 + 7 = 24 birds sitting on the fence. Among them, the number of storks is 3 + 6 = 9.

3. After 15 more minutes, 2 sparrows and 1 egret left the fence.
4. 30 minutes later, 3 additional storks and 4 additional crows arrived.

Now, let's calculate the number of each bird species:

- Sparrows: Initially 2, then 1 more arrived, so 2 + 1 = 3 sparrows. After 2 sparrows left, there were 3 - 2 = 1 sparrow left.
- Crows: Initially 1, then 3 more arrived, so 1 + 3 = 4 crows. After 4 crows left, there were 4 - 4 = 0 crows left.
- Storks: Initially 3, then 6 more arrived, so 3 + 6 = 9 storks. After 3 storks left, there were 9 - 3 = 6 storks left.
- Egrets: Initially 0, then 4 more arrived, so 0 + 4 = 4 egrets. After 1 egret left, there were 4 - 1 = 3 egrets left.

Now, let's calculate the total number of all other bird species combined (excluding storks):

Total other birds = 0 crows + 3 egrets = 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of storks:

88 days * $761/day = $66,968

For the remaining 20 days, it made 487 dollars per day, so the total for those days is:
20 days * $487/day = $9,740

Adding both totals for the first game gives us:

How much did she spend in total?","Let's calculate Olivia's total money after each transaction:

1. Olivia started with $100.
2. She withdrew $200 from the bank, so now she has $100 + $200 = $300.
3. She received and cashed a check for $50, so her total becomes $300 + $50 = $350.

Now, let's calculate how much she spent in the first store:

1. She spent 30% of her $350, which is 0.30 * $350 = $105.

After spending $105 in the first store, she has:

$350 - $105 = $245 left.

In the second store, she spent half of what was left, which is:

Finally, let's check if she indeed has $94 left after spending $227.50:

$350 (initial amount) - $227.50 (total spent) = $122.50.

However, this does not match the final amount of $94 that she is supposed to have left. This means there might be a mistake in the calculation or the information provided. Let's re-calculate the amount left after spending in the second store:

$245 (after first store) - $122.50 (spent in second store) = $122.50.

This matches the amount we calculated earlier, but it does not match the $94 that she is supposed to have left. There seems to be a discrepancy in the information provided. If she indeed has $94 left, let's work backward to find out how much she spent in the second store:

$245 (after first store) - $94 (final amount) = $151 spent in the second store.

This is different from the $122.50 we calculated earlier. Let's now calculate the total amount spent with this new information:

803,"There were 7 roses, 12 orchids, and 5 tulips in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses, orchids, and tulips from her flower garden and added them to the vase. There are now 11 roses, 20 orchids, and 10 tulips in the vase. The ratio of roses to orchids in the vase has also changed. If the ratio of roses to orchids is now 2:5, and the ratio of roses to tulips is 3:5, determine the difference in the quantity of roses and orchids in the vase after Jessica added the new flowers.","Let's first calculate how many new flowers Jessica added to the vase.

Originally, there were 7 roses, and now there are 11 roses. So, Jessica added 11 - 7 = 4 new roses.

Originally, there were 12 orchids, and now there are 20 orchids. So, Jessica added 20 - 12 = 8 new orchids.

Originally, there were 5 tulips, and now there are 10 tulips. So, Jessica added 10 - 5 = 5 new tulips.

Now, let's check the ratios after adding the new flowers.

The ratio of roses to orchids is given as 2:5. With 11 roses and 20 orchids, the ratio is indeed 11/20, which simplifies to 2/5 when both numbers are divided by 5.5 (since 11 ÷ 5.5 = 2 and 20 ÷ 5.5 = 5).

The ratio of roses to tulips is given as 3:5. With 11 roses and 10 tulips, the ratio is indeed 11/10, which simplifies to 3/5 when both numbers are divided by 3.6667 (since 11 ÷ 3.6667 ≈ 3 and 10 ÷ 3.6667 ≈ 5).

Now, to determine the difference in the quantity of roses and orchids in the vase after Jessica added the new flowers, we subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids:

20 orchids - 11 roses = 9

So, the difference in the quantity of roses and orchids in the vase after Jessica added the new flowers is 9.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 7 roses and 12 orchids. The ratio of roses to orchids is 7:12, which simplifies to 1:2.

2. After Jessica adds flowers, the ratio changes to 2:5. We can multiply both ratios by 10 to simplify further:

 10 x 1:2 = 10:24

3. 10:24 equals 25:48 in roses:orchids. The difference between the number of orchids and roses is 48 - 25 = 23.

4. The final result is 23.
 
Twenty-three.","Let's denote the number of roses Jessica added as R, the number of orchids as O, and the number of tulips as T.

From the information given, we have the following equations:

1) Before Jessica added the new flowers, there were 7 roses, 12 orchids, and 5 tulips. So we can write:
7 = R + 7
12 = O + 12
5 = T + 5

2) After Jessica added the new flowers, there were 11 roses, 20 orchids, and 10 tulips. So we can write:
11 = R + 7
20 = O + 12
10 = T + 5

3) The ratio of roses to orchids is now 2:5, so we can write:
R / O = 2 / 5

4) The ratio of roses to tulips is 3:5, so we can write:
R / T = 3 / 5

5) We can express the number of roses in terms of the number of orchids using the ratio of roses to orchids:
R = (2/5) * O

6) We can express the number of roses in terms of the number of tulips using the ratio of roses to tulips:
R = (3/5) * T

7) Now we can substitute the expression for R from equation 5 into equation 6:
(3/5) * T = (2/5) * O

Since we know the number of roses before Jessica added the new flowers (7), we can solve for T:

(3/5) * T = (2/5) * 7
T = (2/5) * 7 * (5/3)
T = (2/5) * (7/3)
T = (2/5) * (7/3)
T = (14/15)

Now we can find the number of roses after Jessica added the new flowers:

R = (2/5) * O
R = (2/5) * 20
R = (2/5) * (20/5)
R = (2/5) * (4/1)
R = (8/5)

Now we can find the difference in the quantity of roses and orchids in the vase after Jessica added the new flowers:

Difference = R - O
Difference = (8/5) - 20
Difference = (8/5) - (40/5)
Difference = (8/5) - (8/5)
Difference = 0

So the difference in the quantity of roses and orchids in the vase after Jessica added the new flowers is",Twenty three,0,nine
804,"In a school, there are 315 girls and 309 boys in grade 6, and 375 girls and 341 boys in grade 7. Additionally, there are 80 members in the drama club, of which 30% are boys. Furthermore, there are 772 teachers, and the school maintains a student-to-teacher ratio of 15:1. Calculate the total number of students in the school, the number of girls in the drama club, and the number of boys in each grade level.","First, let's calculate the total number of students in grades 6 and 7:

Grade 6 students = Number of girls + Number of boys
Grade 6 students = 315 girls + 309 boys
Grade 6 students = 624 students

Grade 7 students = Number of girls + Number of boys
Grade 7 students = 375 girls + 341 boys
Grade 7 students = 716 students

Now, let's find the total number of students in the school:

Total students = Grade 6 students + Grade 7 students
Total students = 624 + 716
Total students = 1340 students

Next, let's calculate the number of boys in the drama club:

Boys in drama club = 30% of total drama club members
Boys in drama club = 30/100 * 80
Boys in drama club = 24 boys

Now, let's find the number of girls in the drama club:

Girls in drama club = Total drama club members - Boys in drama club
Girls in drama club = 80 - 24
Girls in drama club = 56 girls

Finally, let's calculate the number of boys in each grade level:

We already have the number of boys in each grade level from the initial information provided:

Boys in grade 6 = 309 boys
Boys in grade 7 = 341 boys

To summarize:
- Total number of students in the school: 1340 students
- Number of girls in the drama club: 56 girls
- Number of boys in grade 6: 309 boys
- Number of boys in grade 7: 341 boys

(Note: The information about the 772 teachers and the student-to-teacher ratio is not needed for the calculations requested.)","Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: There are 315 + 375 = 690 girls in grades 6 and 7 combined.

Step 2: There are 309 + 341 = 650 boys in grades 6 and 7 combined.

Step 3: To find the total number of students, we multiply the student-teacher ratio by the number of teachers: 15 students/teacher x 772 teachers = 11,580 students. 

Step 4: Now, let's find the number of girls in the drama club. 80 members x 30% = 24 girls are in the drama club.

Step 5: To find the number of boys in the drama club, we subtract the number of girls from the total club members: 80 - 24 = 56 boys.

Step 6: Thus, the total number of boys in the school is 650 - 56 = 594.

Result: 1184.

Therefore, the final answer is 1184 students.","Let's calculate the total number of students in the school first.

The school maintains a student-to-teacher ratio of 15:1. This means that for every 15 students, there is 1 teacher.

First, let's find out how many teachers there are for the students in grade 6 and grade 7.

For grade 6:
315 girls * 15:1 = 4725 students

For grade 7:
375 girls * 15:1 = 5625 students

Now, let's add the number of students in grade 6 and grade 7 to get the total number of students:
4725 (grade 6) + 5625 (grade 7) = 10350 students

Now, let's calculate the number of girls in the drama club. We know that 30% of the drama club members are boys, so the remaining 70% must be girls.

There are 80 members in the drama club, so 30% of them are boys:
30% of 80 = 0.30 * 80 = 24 boys

Now, let's find out the number of girls in the drama club:
80 (total members) - 24 (boys) = 56 girls

Next, let's calculate the number of boys in each grade level.

For grade 6:
309 boys

For grade 7:
341 boys

Now, let's add the number of boys in grade 6 and grade 7 to get the total number of boys:
309 (grade 6) + 341 (grade 7) = 650 boys

In summary:
- Total number of students in the school: 10350

805,"Emily is making bead necklaces for her friends. She made 11 necklaces, using 3 different types of beads: round beads, square beads, and heart-shaped beads. She used a total of 308 beads. She used twice as many round beads as square beads and one-third as many heart-shaped beads as round beads. How many of each type of beads did Emily use?","Let's denote the number of square beads as S, the number of round beads as R, and the number of heart-shaped beads as H.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. R = 2S (twice as many round beads as square beads)
2. H = 1/3 R (one-third as many heart-shaped beads as round beads)
3. R + S + H = 308 (total number of beads used)

From the first relationship, we can express R in terms of S:
R = 2S

From the second relationship, we can express H in terms of R:
H = 1/3 R

Now, we can substitute R and H in terms of S into the third equation:
2S (for R) + S + 1/3 (2S) (for H) = 308

Combining like terms:
2S + S + 2/3 S = 308
3S + 2/3 S = 308
(9/3)S + (2/3)S = 308
(11/3)S = 308

Now, we can solve for S:
S = 308 * (3/11)
S = 84

Now that we have the number of square beads (S), we can find the number of round beads (R) and heart-shaped beads (H):

R = 2S
R = 2 * 84
R = 168

H = 1/3 R
H = 1/3 * 168
H = 56

So, Emily used 84 square beads, 168 round beads, and 56 heart-shaped beads.","Emily used 56 square beads, 112 round beads, and 38 heart-shaped beads.
The total adds up to 308 beads.
38.","Let's denote the number of round beads as R, the number of square beads as S, and the number of heart-shaped beads as H.

According to the information given, Emily used twice as many round beads as square beads, so we can write:
R = 2S

She also used one-third as many heart-shaped beads as round beads, so we can write:
H = (1/3)R

Now, we can substitute the expression for R from the first equation into the second equation:
H = (1/3)(2S)
H = (2/3)S

We know that Emily used a total of 308 beads, so we can write:
R + S + H = 308

Substitute the expression for H from the second equation into the first equation:
2S + S + (2/3)S = 308

Combine like terms:
(2/3)S + S = 308

Now, combine the fractions:
(2/3)S + S = (2/3)S + (1/3)S
= (2/3)S + (1/3)S
= (2/3 + 1/3)S
= (3/3)S
= S

So, S = 308 / 3 = 102.67 (approximately). Since Emily can't use a fraction of a bead, we'll round this to 103.

Now, we can find the number of round beads (R) using the first equation:
R = 2S
R = 2 * 103
R = 206

Finally, we can find the number of heart-shaped beads (H) using the second equation:
H = (2/3)S
H = (2/3) * 103
H = (2/3) * 103
H = 206 / 3
H = 68.67 (approximately). Since Emily can't use a fraction of a bead, we'll round this to 69.

In summary, Emily used:
- 206 round beads
- 103 square beads
- 69 heart-shaped beads",38,206,84

808,"Debby bought some water bottles when they were on sale. She drank a varying amount of bottles per day based on the day of the week.

If the bottles lasted for 74 days, how many bottles had she bought? Additionally, she gave away 5% of the total bottles she bought to her friends. Take into account the bottles given away in the total count.","First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Debby drank each week by adding the number of bottles she drank each day:

Monday: 20 bottles
Tuesday: 15 bottles
Wednesday: 25 bottles
Thursday: 18 bottles
Friday: 22 bottles
Saturday: 30 bottles
Sunday: 28 bottles

Total per week = 20 + 15 + 25 + 18 + 22 + 30 + 28 = 158 bottles

Since the bottles lasted for 74 days, we need to find out how many weeks are in 74 days:

74 days ÷ 7 days/week = 10 weeks and 4 days

Now, let's calculate the total number of bottles Debby drank for the full weeks:

10 weeks × 158 bottles/week = 1580 bottles

For the remaining 4 days, we need to add the number of bottles she drank on those specific days. Since we don't know which day of the week she started, we'll assume the pattern continues in the same order. The first four days of the week are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, so:

Monday: 20 bottles
Tuesday: 15 bottles
Wednesday: 25 bottles
Thursday: 18 bottles

Total for the remaining 4 days = 20 + 15 + 25 + 18 = 78 bottles

Now, let's add the bottles from the full weeks and the remaining 4 days:

1580 bottles (full weeks) + 78 bottles (remaining days) = 1658 bottles

Debby gave away 5% of the total bottles she bought to her friends. To find out how many bottles this is, we calculate 5% of 1658 bottles:

5% of 1658 bottles = 0.05 × 1658 = 82.9 bottles

Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. If we round down, Debby gave away 82 bottles. If we round up, she gave away 83 bottles. We'll round up because typically when giving away items, you wouldn't give away a fraction of an item.

Now, let's add the bottles given away to the total number of bottles Debby drank to find out how many bottles she had bought:

1658 bottles (drank) + 83 bottles (given away) = 1741 bottles

Therefore, Debby had bought 1741 bottles.","Debby's drinking pattern changes from day to day, but we can calculate the average number of bottles she consumes each day. 

Over the week, she drank a total of 15 + 25 + 18 + 22 + 30 + 28 = 138 bottles. As this pattern repeats each week, we can divide the total number of days the bottles lasted by the number of bottles consumed each day: 74 ÷ 138 = 0.535.

This means that Debby originally purchased 0.535 x 2 = 1.07 bottles for every day of the week. As she also gave away 5% of the total bottles, we must multiply this number by 95% to get the actual number of bottles she bought: 1.07 x 0.95 = 1.0165, or **101.65** bottles. 

The final result is preferred as a single number.","First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Debby drank over the 74 days.

On Fridays, she drank 22 bottles.
On Saturdays, she drank 30 bottles.
On Sundays, she drank 28 bottles.

Now, let's add up all the bottles she drank:

(20 + 15 + 25 + 18 + 22 + 30 + 28) = 178 bottles

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles she bought, taking into account the bottles given away. Since she gave away 5% of the total bottles, we'll calculate 5% of the total bottles she drank and subtract that from the total bottles she drank.

5% of 178 bottles = (5/100) * 178 = 0.05 * 178 = 9.9 bottles

How many peaches are there in total?,"To find the total number of peaches, we need to calculate the number of peaches in the odd-numbered baskets and the even-numbered baskets separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many odd-numbered and even-numbered baskets there are out of the 150 baskets.

Since the sequence of odd and even numbers alternates, half of the baskets will be odd-numbered and the other half will be even-numbered. So, we have:

Number of odd-numbered baskets = 150 / 2 = 75
Number of even-numbered baskets = 150 / 2 = 75

Now, let's calculate the peaches in the odd-numbered baskets:

Each odd-numbered basket has 8 red peaches and 6 green peaches, so each odd-numbered basket has a total of 8 + 6 = 14 peaches.

Total peaches in odd-numbered baskets = 75 baskets * 14 peaches/basket = 1050 peaches

Next, let's calculate the peaches in the even-numbered baskets:

Each even-numbered basket has 5 red peaches and 7 green peaches, so each even-numbered basket has a total of 5 + 7 = 12 peaches.

Total peaches in even-numbered baskets = 75 baskets * 12 peaches/basket = 900 peaches

Finally, let's add the peaches from the odd-numbered and even-numbered baskets to find the total number of peaches:

Total peaches = peaches in odd-numbered baskets + peaches in even-numbered baskets
Total peaches = 1050 peaches + 900 peaches
Total peaches = 1950 peaches

Therefore, there are 1950 peaches in total.","We have 150 baskets, with half of them being even-numbered and half being odd-numbered:

- Even-numbered baskets contain 5 red + 7 green = 12 peaches. 
- Odd-numbered baskets contain 8 red + 6 green = 14 peaches.

The total number of peaches is: 12 x 75 + 14 x 75 = 900 peaches. 

Therefore the final result is 900.","First, let's find out how many odd and even numbered baskets there are.

There are 150 baskets in total. To find out how many odd and even baskets there are, we divide the total number of baskets by 2:

150 baskets ÷ 2 = 75 odd numbered baskets

Now, let's calculate the number of peaches in each type of basket.

For the odd numbered baskets:
8 red peaches per basket × 75 odd numbered baskets = 600 red peaches
6 green peaches per basket × 75 odd numbered baskets = 450 green peaches

For the even numbered baskets:
5 red peaches per basket × 75 even numbered baskets = 375 red peaches
7 green peaches per basket × 75 even numbered baskets = 525 green peaches

Now, let's add up all the peaches:

Total red peaches = 600 (from odd baskets) + 375 (from even baskets) = 975 red peaches
Total green peaches = 450 (from odd baskets) + 525 (from even baskets) = 975 green peaches

Total pages = 2 + 3 + 10 + 4 + 5 + 8 = 32 pages

Rachel spent 30% of her total study time on biology and the same amount of time on reading, which means she spent 30% + 30% = 60% of her time on biology and reading combined.

Since the total study time is 100%, the remaining time spent on math, history, physics, and chemistry combined would be:

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, let's find out how much time Rachel spent on biology and reading, which is 30% of her total study time.

Total study time = 100%
Time spent on biology and reading = 30%

Time spent on biology and reading = 30% * Total study time
Time spent on biology and reading = 30% * 100%
Time spent on biology and reading = 30%

Now, let's find out how much time Rachel spent on math, history, physics, and chemistry combined.

Time spent on math, history, physics, and chemistry = Total study time - Time spent on biology and reading
Time spent on math, history, physics, and chemistry = 100% - 30%
Time spent on math, history, physics, and chemistry = 70%

To find out the percentage of her total study time that Rachel spent on math, history, physics, and chemistry combined, we divide the time spent on these subjects by the total study time and then multiply by 100%.

Sold to customers: 381 cakes
Given to friends: 123 cakes
Given to charity: 44.5 cakes

Total given away = 123 + 44.5 = 167.5 cakes

Next, let's see how many cakes the baker bought:

Bought new cakes: 154.7 cakes

Now, to find out how many more cakes the baker bought than those he sold and gave away, we subtract the total sold and given away from the number of cakes bought:

More cakes bought = Bought new cakes - Total sold and given away
More cakes bought = 154.7 - 548.5

813,"A grocery store had 114 bottles of regular soda, 82 bottles of diet soda, 45 liters of milk, and 64 bananas. 35% of the regular soda bottles were in packs of 6, 60% of the diet soda bottles were in packs of 4, and 75% of the milk was in 2-liter bottles. How many more bottles of regular soda in packs of 6 than diet soda bottles in packs of 4 did they have?","First, let's calculate the number of regular soda bottles in packs of 6. 

35% of 114 bottles = 0.35 * 114 = 39.9

Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle, we'll round this to 40 bottles. These 40 bottles are in packs of 6, so we need to find out how many packs there are:

40 bottles / 6 bottles per pack = 6.6667 packs

Again, we can't have a fraction of a pack, so we'll round down to 6 packs (since we can't have more than what we started with).

Now, let's calculate the number of diet soda bottles in packs of 4.

60% of 82 bottles = 0.60 * 82 = 49.2

We'll round this to 49 bottles. These 49 bottles are in packs of 4, so we need to find out how many packs there are:

49 bottles / 4 bottles per pack = 12.25 packs

We'll round down to 12 packs for the same reason as before.

Now, let's find out how many more bottles of regular soda in packs of 6 there are than diet soda bottles in packs of 4:

Regular soda bottles in packs of 6: 6 packs * 6 bottles per pack = 36 bottles
Diet soda bottles in packs of 4: 12 packs * 4 bottles per pack = 48 bottles

Difference: 36 bottles (regular) - 48 bottles (diet) = -12 bottles

So, there are actually 12 fewer bottles of regular soda in packs of 6 than diet soda bottles in packs of 4, not more.","Let's solve this step by step.

First, we find the number of regular soda bottles in packs of 6. 35% of 114 bottles means we have 35 x 114 / 100 = 40 bottles in packs of 6.

Next, we find the number of diet soda bottles in packs of 4. 60% of 82 bottles is 60 x 82 / 100 = 49 bottles in packs of 4.

Now, we can determine the difference, which is 40 bottles - 49 bottles = -9 bottles.

The grocery store had 9 fewer bottles of regular soda in packs of 6 than diet soda bottles in packs of 4.

-9","First, let's calculate the number of regular soda bottles in packs of 6 and the number of diet soda bottles in packs of 4.

35% of the regular soda bottles were in packs of 6, so we calculate:
35% of 114 bottles = 0.35 * 114 = 40 bottles

Now, let's find out how many regular soda bottles were not in packs of 6:
114 bottles - 40 bottles = 74 bottles

Since 60% of the diet soda bottles were in packs of 4, we calculate:
60% of 82 bottles = 0.60 * 82 = 50 bottles

Now, let's find out how many diet soda bottles were not in packs of 4:
82 bottles - 50 bottles = 32 bottles

Finally, we subtract the number of diet soda bottles in packs of 4 from the number of regular soda bottles in packs of 6 to find out how many more bottles of regular soda in packs of 6 they had than diet soda bottles in packs of 4:
40 bottles (regular soda in packs of 6) - 50 bottles (diet soda in packs of 4) = -10 bottles

Since the result is negative, it means they had 10 more diet soda bottles in packs of 4 than regular soda bottles in packs of 6.",-9,10,12
814,"In a basket containing a total of 612 fruits, there are a mixture of red peaches, yellow peaches, green peaches, and blue peaches in the proportion 1:5:3:4. Determine how many red and green peaches are in the basket.","To determine the number of red and green peaches in the basket, we first need to find out the total parts that represent the mixture of peaches. According to the given proportions, we have:

Red peaches: 1 part
Yellow peaches: 5 parts
Green peaches: 3 parts
Blue peaches: 4 parts

Now, let's add up these parts to find the total number of parts:

Total parts = 1 (red) + 5 (yellow) + 3 (green) + 4 (blue)
Total parts = 13 parts

We know that these 13 parts represent the total number of fruits in the basket, which is 612. To find out how many fruits each part represents, we divide the total number of fruits by the total number of parts:

Fruits per part = Total number of fruits / Total parts
Fruits per part = 612 / 13
Fruits per part = 47

Now that we know each part represents 47 fruits, we can calculate the number of red and green peaches:

Red peaches = 1 part * 47 fruits per part
Red peaches = 47

Green peaches = 3 parts * 47 fruits per part
Green peaches = 141

Therefore, there are 47 red peaches and 141 green peaches in the basket.","To solve this problem, we should multiply each term in the proportion with the total number of fruits, 612.

The number of red peaches: 1 × 612 = 612
The number of green peaches: 3 × 612 = 1836

Thus, there are 1836 red and green peaches in the basket.

**1836**","Let's denote the number of red peaches as R, the number of yellow peaches as Y, the number of green peaches as G, and the number of blue peaches as B.

According to the given proportions, we have:

R : Y : G : B = 1 : 5 : 3 : 4

We are given that the total number of fruits in the basket is 612. Let's denote the total number of peaches as P. Since the total number of fruits is the sum of all the peaches, we have:

P = R + Y + G + B

We are not given the total number of peaches, but we can express it in terms of the proportions:

P = (1/6) * 612
P = 102

Now we can express the total number of peaches in terms of the proportions:

P = (1/6) * 612
P = (1/6) * (5 * R + 3 * G + 4 * B)
P = (5/6) * R + (3/6) * G + (4/6) * B

We know that P = 102, so we can set up the equation:

102 = (5/6) * R + (3/6) * G + (4/6) * B

Now we can solve for R and G. Since we are not given the total number of peaches, we cannot determine the exact number of red and green peaches. However, we can express the number of red and green peaches in terms of the total number of peaches.

Let's denote the total number of peaches as P:

R = (1/6) * P
G = (3/6) * P

So, the number of red peaches is (1/6) * P, and the number of green peaches is (3/6) * P.

If you can provide the total number of peaches, we can then determine the exact number of red and green peaches.",1836,P,141

How many peaches does Jake have?","Let's start by figuring out how many peaches Jill has. Since Steven has 15 peaches and he has 14 more peaches than Jill, we can calculate Jill's peaches as follows:

Steven's peaches = Jill's peaches + 14
15 = Jill's peaches + 14
Jill's peaches = 15 - 14
Jill's peaches = 1

Now that we know Jill has 1 peach, let's find out how many peaches Jasmine has. Jasmine has 3 times the amount of peaches that Jill has minus 5, so:

Jasmine's peaches = (3 * Jill's peaches) - 5
Jasmine's peaches = (3 * 1) - 5
Jasmine's peaches = 3 - 5
Jasmine's peaches = -2

However, it's not possible to have a negative number of peaches, so there might be a misunderstanding in the information provided about Jasmine's peaches. Let's ignore Jasmine's peaches for now and focus on Jake's peaches.

Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, so:

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 7
Jake's peaches = 15 - 7
Jake's peaches = 8

Jake has 8 peaches.","Steven has 15 peaches, and Jill has 15 - 14 = 1 peach.
Jasmine has 3 x 1 - 5 = 2 peaches.
So, Jake has 15 - 7 = 8 peaches.

Eight.","Let's start by figuring out how many peaches Jill has. We know that Steven has 15 peaches and he has 14 more than Jill. So, Jill has:

15 - 14 = 1 peach

Now, we know that Jasmine has 3 times the amount of peaches that Jill has minus 5. So, Jasmine has:

3 * 1 - 5 = 3 - 5 = -2 peaches

Since Jasmine has -2 peaches, we need to correct this by adding 2 to the number of peaches she has. So, Jasmine has:

3 * 1 - 5 + 2 = 3 - 5 + 2 = 0 peaches

Now we know that Jasmine has 0 peaches. Since Jasmine has 3 times the amount of peaches that Jill has minus 5, and Jill has 1 peach, Jasmine should have:

3 * 1 = 3 peaches

But we found that Jasmine has 0 peaches, so we need to correct this by adding 3 to the number of peaches she has. So, Jasmine has:

0 + 3 = 3 peaches

Now we know that Jasmine has 3 peaches. Since Jasmine has 3 times the amount of peaches that Jill has minus 5, and Jill has 1 peach, Jasmine should have:

3 * 1 = 3 peaches

Now we know that Jasmine has 3 peaches. Since Jasmine has 3 times the amount of peaches that Jill has minus 5, and Jill has 1 peach, Jasmine should have:

Machine B produces 8 shirts per minute and it worked for 10 minutes yesterday and 15 minutes today. Machine C produces 5 shirts per minute and it worked for 20 minutes yesterday and did not work today. How many shirts did the machines produce altogether?,"Let's calculate the number of shirts produced by each machine separately and then add them up to get the total.

Machine A:
Yesterday: 6 shirts/minute * 12 minutes = 72 shirts
Today: 6 shirts/minute * 10 minutes = 60 shirts
Total for Machine A = 72 + 60 = 132 shirts

Machine B:
Yesterday: 8 shirts/minute * 10 minutes = 80 shirts
Today: 8 shirts/minute * 15 minutes = 120 shirts
Total for Machine B = 80 + 120 = 200 shirts

Machine C:
Yesterday: 5 shirts/minute * 20 minutes = 100 shirts
Today: Machine C did not work, so 0 shirts
Total for Machine C = 100 + 0 = 100 shirts

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts produced by all machines:
Total shirts = Machine A + Machine B + Machine C
Total shirts = 132 + 200 + 100
Total shirts = 432

Altogether, the machines produced 432 shirts.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the total number of shirts produced by Machine A: 6 shirts/minute x 12 minutes = 72 shirts (yesterday) + 6 shirts/minute x 10 minutes = 60 shirts (today), which is 132 shirts in total.

2. Calculate the total number of shirts produced by Machine B: 8 shirts/minute x 10 minutes = 80 shirts (yesterday) + 8 shirts/minute x 15 minutes = 120 shirts (today), giving us a total of 200 shirts.

3. Calculate the total number of shirts produced by Machine C: 5 shirts/minute x 20 minutes = 100 shirts (yesterday). Machine C didn't work today.

4. Add up the total number of shirts produced by all three machines: 132 shirts (Machine A) + 200 shirts (Machine B) + 100 shirts (Machine C) = 432 shirts.

The number of suggestions for each food is as follows: 
- Sushi: 297

- Tomatoes: 79

We can divide each of these values by the lowest value, which is 144. This will give us the required ratios:
- Sushi: 2.06
- Bacon: 3.24
- Tomatoes: 0.55

The result is 2.06:1.44:3.24:0.55.

818,"Luke played a trivia game and scored 154 points. If he gained 5 points in the first round and the points earned increased by 3 for each subsequent round, how many rounds did he play?","Let's denote the number of rounds Luke played as n. 

In the first round, he scored 5 points. For each subsequent round, he scored 3 more points than the previous round. So, the points he scored in each round form an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 5 and a common difference d = 3.

The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d

The total points Luke scored can be found by summing up the points from all rounds. The sum S_n of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)

We know that S_n = 154 (total points scored by Luke), a_1 = 5, and d = 3. We need to find n and a_n.

First, let's express a_n in terms of n:
a_n = 5 + (n - 1) * 3
a_n = 5 + 3n - 3
a_n = 3n + 2

Now, let's substitute a_n in the sum formula:
154 = n/2 * (5 + 3n + 2)
154 = n/2 * (3n + 7)

Now, let's solve for n:
154 = (3n^2 + 7n)/2
308 = 3n^2 + 7n
3n^2 + 7n - 308 = 0

This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for n using the quadratic formula:
n = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

In this case, a = 3, b = 7, and c = -308. Let's calculate the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) first:
Discriminant = b^2 - 4ac
Discriminant = 7^2 - 4(3)(-308)
Discriminant = 49 + 3696
Discriminant = 3745

Now, let's use the quadratic formula:
n = [-7 ± sqrt(3745)] / (2*3)
n = [-7 ± sqrt(3745)] / 6

Since the number of rounds played cannot be negative, we only consider the positive solution:
n = (-7 + sqrt(3745)) / 6

Let's calculate the value of n:
n ≈ (-7 + 61.2) / 6
n ≈ 54.2 / 6
n ≈ 9.03

Since the number of rounds played must be a whole number, we round n to the nearest whole number. Since 9.03 is closer to 9 than to 10, Luke played 9 rounds.","Luke's score increased by 3 points in each round, starting from the second round. We need to find how many rounds he played to reach 154 points.

Starting with 5 points earned in the first round, the score after the second round would be 5 + 3 = 8 points.

Assuming the score increases by 3 times the previous round's points each time, the third round score would be 8 + 3 = 11 points. 

This pattern can continue as follows:
• Round 3: 11 points
• Round 4: 11 + 3 = 14 points
• Round 5: 14 + 3 = 17 points
• Round 6: 17 + 3 = 20 points
• Round 7: 20 + 3 = 23 points
• Round 8: 23 + 3 = 26 points
• Round 9: 26 + 3 = 29 points
• Round 10: 29 + 3 = 32 points

Since 32 points is less than Luke's total score of 154 points, we can conclude that he played **10 rounds** in total.

The answer is 10.","Let's denote the number of rounds Luke played as \( n \).

In the first round, Luke gained 5 points, so the points earned in the first round are \( 5 \).

In the second round, the points earned increased by 3, so the points earned in the second round are \( 5 + 3 = 8 \).

In the third round, the points earned increased by another 3, so the points earned in the third round are \( 8 + 3 = 11 \).

This pattern continues for each subsequent round, with the points earned increasing by 3 each time.

To find out how many rounds Luke played, we need to determine when the points earned stop increasing by 3 each round.

Let's look at the points earned in each round:

- First round: \( 5 \) points
- Second round: \( 8 \) points
- Third round: \( 11 \) points
- Fourth round: \( 11 + 3 = 14 \) points
- Fifth round: \( 14 + 3 = 17 \) points

We can see that after the fifth round, the points earned stop increasing by 3 each round. Therefore, Luke played 5 rounds in total.",10,Five.,9
819,"Jesse has 20 rooms in her house with the following dimensions and shapes:

1. 5 Rectangular rooms: each 19 feet long and 18 feet wide
2. 5 Square rooms: each 15 feet by 15 feet
3. 4 Triangular rooms: each with a base of 12 feet and a height of 10 feet
4. 3 Trapezoidal rooms: each with bases of 10 and 14 feet, and a height of 8 feet
5. 2 Circular rooms: each with a radius of 6 feet
6. 1 Elliptical room: with a major axis of 14 feet and a minor axis of 8 feet

Given the size and shape of each room type, how much carpet does Jesse need to cover the floors of all the rooms? Additionally, if Jesse has a budget of $10,000 for buying carpet, and carpet costs $5 per square foot, can she stay within budget?","To determine how much carpet Jesse needs, we need to calculate the area of each room type and then sum them up.

1. Rectangular rooms:
Area of one rectangular room = length × width
= 19 feet × 18 feet
= 342 square feet
Since there are 5 rectangular rooms, the total area for rectangular rooms = 5 × 342 square feet
= 1710 square feet

2. Square rooms:
Area of one square room = side × side
= 15 feet × 15 feet
= 225 square feet
Since there are 5 square rooms, the total area for square rooms = 5 × 225 square feet
= 1125 square feet

3. Triangular rooms:
Area of one triangular room = (base × height) / 2
= (12 feet × 10 feet) / 2
= 60 square feet
Since there are 4 triangular rooms, the total area for triangular rooms = 4 × 60 square feet
= 240 square feet

4. Trapezoidal rooms:
Area of one trapezoidal room = (base1 + base2) / 2 × height
= (10 feet + 14 feet) / 2 × 8 feet
= 24 feet × 8 feet
= 192 square feet
Since there are 3 trapezoidal rooms, the total area for trapezoidal rooms = 3 × 192 square feet
= 576 square feet

5. Circular rooms:
Area of one circular room = π × radius²
= π × (6 feet)²
= π × 36 square feet
≈ 113.097 square feet (using π ≈ 3.14159)
Since there are 2 circular rooms, the total area for circular rooms = 2 × 113.097 square feet
≈ 226.194 square feet

6. Elliptical room:
Area of the elliptical room = π × (major axis / 2) × (minor axis / 2)
= π × (14 feet / 2) × (8 feet / 2)
= π × 7 feet × 4 feet
= 28π square feet
≈ 87.9646 square feet (using π ≈ 3.14159)

Now, let's sum up the total area for all rooms:
Total area = 1710 + 1125 + 240 + 576 + 226.194 + 87.9646
≈ 3965 + 314.1586
≈ 4279.1586 square feet

Now, let's calculate if Jesse can stay within the budget:
Cost of carpet per square foot = $5
Total cost = Total area × Cost per square foot
= 4279.1586 square feet × $5
≈ $21395.793

Jesse's budget is $10,000, which is not enough to cover the total cost of $21395.793. Therefore, Jesse cannot stay within the budget.","To solve this problem, let's go through each room shape one by one and calculate the area that needs to be carpeted.

1. Rectangular rooms (5 rooms):
Area of one room = Length × Width = 19ft × 18ft = 342 sq.ft
Total area for 5 rooms = 5 × 342 sq.ft = 1710 sq.ft

2. Square rooms (5 rooms):
Area of one room = Side × Side = 15ft × 15ft = 225 sq.ft
Total area for 5 rooms = 5 × 225 sq.ft = 1125 sq.ft

3. Triangular rooms (4 rooms):
Area of one room = 1/2 × Base × Height = 1/2 × 12ft × 10ft = 60 sq.ft
Total area for 4 rooms = 4 × 60 sq.ft = 240 sq.ft

4. Trapezoidal rooms (3 rooms):
Area of one room = 1/2 × Sum of the bases × Height = 1/2 × (10ft + 14ft) × 8ft = 88 sq.ft
Total area for 3 rooms = 3 × 88 sq.ft = 264 sq.ft

5. Circular rooms (2 rooms):
Area of one room = π × Radius^2 = 2 × 3.14 × 6ft^2 ≈ 113.04 sq.ft
Total area for 2 rooms = 2 × 113.04 sq.ft = 226.08 sq.ft

6. Elliptical room (1 room):
Area of the room = π × Major Axis × Minor Axis = 8ft × 14ft × 3.14 = 392 sq.ft

Adding up all the areas, Jesse needs a total of 392 + 226.08 + 264 + 240 + 1125 + 1710 = 3765.08 sq.ft of carpet.

With a budget of $10,000 and a carpet cost of $5 per sq.ft, Jesse can stay within budget as 3765.08 sq.ft × $5 = $18,825.40.

Therefore, the final answer is yes.","First, let's calculate the area of each room type:

1. Rectangular rooms:
Area = length × width
Area = 19 feet × 18 feet
Area = 342 square feet

2. Square rooms:
Area = side × side
Area = 15 feet × 15 feet
Area = 225 square feet

3. Triangular rooms:
Area = (base × height) / 2
Area = (12 feet × 10 feet) / 2
Area = 120 square feet / 2
Area = 60 square feet

4. Trapezoidal rooms:
Area = (base1 + base2) × height / 2
Area = (10 feet + 14 feet) × 8 feet / 2
Area = (24 feet) × 8 feet / 2
Area = 192 square feet / 2
Area = 96 square feet

5. Circular rooms:
Area = π × radius^2
Area = π × 6 feet^2
Area = π × 36 square feet
Area ≈ 113.04 square feet (since π ≈ 3.14)

6. Elliptical room:
Area = (major axis × minor axis) / 2
Area = (14 feet × 8 feet) / 2
Area = 112 square feet / 2
Area = 56 square feet

Now, let's add up the area of all the rooms:

Total area = 342 square feet (rectangular) + 225 square feet (square) + 60 square feet (triangular) + 96 square feet (trapezoidal) + 113.04 square feet (circular) + 56 square feet (elliptical)
Total area = 1132.04 square feet

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the carpet needed:

Total cost = Total area × Cost per square foot

820,"A waiter had 3 customers at the start. After a while, a group of customers arrived, and then a group of customers left. Afterward, another group of customers arrived, and the waiter had a total of 8 customers. If the first group of customers that arrived had x number of members, the second group of customers had y members, and the group that left had z members, find the values of x, y, and z, given the following conditions:

1. The first arrival group (x) had twice the number of members of the group that left (z).
2. The second arrival group (y) was 3 members fewer than the first arrival group (x).

Determine the values of x, y, and z, and calculate the total number of new customers who arrived at the restaurant.","Let's use the given conditions to set up equations.

1. The first arrival group (x) had twice the number of members of the group that left (z).
   So, we can write this as: x = 2z

2. The second arrival group (y) was 3 members fewer than the first arrival group (x).
   So, we can write this as: y = x - 3

We also know that the waiter had 3 customers at the start, and after all the arrivals and departures, the waiter had a total of 8 customers. We can write this as an equation:

3 (initial customers) + x (first arrival) + y (second arrival) - z (group that left) = 8

Now we can substitute the expressions for x and y from the conditions into this equation:

3 + x + (x - 3) - z = 8
3 + 2x - 3 - z = 8 (since x = 2z)
2x - z = 8

Now we have two equations:
1. x = 2z
2. 2x - z = 8

Let's solve these equations simultaneously.

From equation 1, we can substitute x in equation 2:
2(2z) - z = 8
4z - z = 8
3z = 8
z = 8/3

Since z must be a whole number (as it represents the number of people), and the only whole number that can be divided by 3 to give another whole number is a multiple of 3, we can infer that z must be a multiple of 3. The smallest multiple of 3 that is greater than 8/3 (which is approximately 2.67) is 3 itself. So, let's try z = 3.

Now we can find x using equation 1:
x = 2z
x = 2(3)
x = 6

Now we can find y using the expression for y:
y = x - 3
y = 6 - 3
y = 3

So, the values of x, y, and z are 6, 3, and 3, respectively.

To calculate the total number of new customers who arrived at the restaurant, we add x and y:
Total new customers = x + y
Total new customers = 6 + 3
Total new customers = 9

Therefore, the values of x, y, and z are 6, 3, and 3, respectively, and the total number of new customers who arrived at the restaurant is 9.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We start with 3 customers, and the first group arrives, bringing the total to x + 3.
2. A group of z customers leaves, reducing the number to (x - z) + 3.
3. The second group arrives, adding y customers, which brings the total to (x - z) + 3 + y.

4. We know that the total after the second group's arrival is 8 customers, so (x - z) + 3 + y = 8. 
5. We're also given that x is twice the size of z, and y is three less than x. 

Substituting x = 2z and y = x - 3 into the equation above, we get:

2z - z + 3 + (2z - 3) = 8
3z = 8
z = 8/3

Now, we can find x = 2 * 8/3 = 16/3, and y = 16/3 - 3 = 5/3. 

The values of x, y, and z are 16/3, 5/3, and 8/3, respectively. The total number of new customers who arrived is 16/3 + 5/3 = 29/3.

**29/3**","Let's denote the first arrival group (x) as 2z, since it had twice the number of members of the group that left (z).

The second arrival group (y) was 3 members fewer than the first arrival group (x), so y = x - 3.

We know that after the second arrival group, the waiter had a total of 8 customers. So, the total number of customers after the second arrival group is:

Total customers = 3 (initial customers) + 2z (first arrival group) + (x - 3) (second arrival group)

We want to find the values of x, y, and z, so we can plug in the expression for y into the total customers equation:

Total customers = 3 + 2z + (2z - 3)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

Total customers = 3 + 2z + 2z - 3
Total customers = 3 + 4z - 3
Total customers = 3 + 4z

We know that the total number of customers after the second arrival group is 8, so we can set up the equation:

3 + 4z = 8

Now, let's solve for z:

3 + 4z = 8
4z = 8 - 3
4z = 5
z = 5 / 4
z = 1.25

Since z can't be a fraction of a customer, we need to adjust the values. Let's assume the group that left had 1 member (z = 1). Then, the first arrival group (x) would have twice the number of members of the group that left, so x = 2.

The second arrival group (y) was 3 members fewer than the first arrival group (x), so y = x - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1.

However, we can't have a negative number of customers, so we need to adjust the values again. Let's assume the group that left had 2 members (z = 2). Then, the first arrival group (x) would have twice the number of members of the group that left, so x = 2 * 2 = 4.

The second arrival group (y) was 3 members fewer than the first arrival group (x), so y = x - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1.

Now, we have:

- The first arrival group (x) had 4 members.
- The second arrival group (y) had 1 member.
- The group that left (z) had 2 members.

822,Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven and 9 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 16 peaches. Monica has 3 times as many peaches as Jake. How many peaches does each person have?,"Let's start by figuring out how many peaches Jake has. Since Steven has 16 peaches and Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, we can calculate Jake's peaches as follows:

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 7
Jake's peaches = 16 - 7
Jake's peaches = 9

Now we know Jake has 9 peaches.

Next, let's find out how many peaches Jill has. Since Jake has 9 more peaches than Jill, we can calculate Jill's peaches as follows:

Jill's peaches = Jake's peaches - 9
Jill's peaches = 9 - 9
Jill's peaches = 0

So, Jill has 0 peaches.

Finally, let's determine how many peaches Monica has. Since Monica has 3 times as many peaches as Jake, we can calculate Monica's peaches as follows:

Monica's peaches = 3 * Jake's peaches
Monica's peaches = 3 * 9
Monica's peaches = 27

Therefore, Monica has 27 peaches.

In summary:
- Jake has 9 peaches.
- Jill has 0 peaches.
- Steven has 16 peaches.
- Monica has 27 peaches.","1. Steven has 16 peaches.
2. Jake has 16 - 7 = 9 peaches.
3. Jill has 9 - 9 = 0 peaches.
4. Monica has 3 x 9 = 27 peaches.

Peaches: 16 9 0 27","Let's denote the number of peaches Steven has as S, the number of peaches Jill has as J, and the number of peaches Jake has as J.

According to the information given, Steven has 16 peaches, so S = 16.

Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, so J = S - 7 = 16 - 7 = 9.

Jake has 9 more peaches than Jill, so J = J + 9. This means that Jill has 0 peaches, because if Jill had any peaches, Jake would have 9 more than that, which would make J greater than 9, which contradicts the fact that J = 9.

Now, we know that Jake has 9 peaches, so we can find out how many peaches Monica has. Monica has 3 times as many peaches as Jake, so Monica has 3 * J = 3 * 9 = 27 peaches.

In summary, Steven has 16 peaches, Jill has 0 peaches, Jake has 9 peaches, and Monica has 27 peaches.",27,27,27
823,"Julia played tag with 14 kids on Tuesday and decided to play with 25% more kids on Wednesday. On Thursday, she played with twice as many kids as she played with on Wednesday minus 4 kids. If she played tag with 8 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday, how many kids did she play with on each day from Monday to Thursday?","Let's calculate the number of kids Julia played with each day step by step:

Tuesday:
Julia played with 14 kids.

Wednesday:
Julia decided to play with 25% more kids than on Tuesday. To find out how many more kids that is, we calculate 25% of 14:
25% of 14 = 0.25 * 14 = 3.5

Since she can't play with half a kid, we'll round to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round up because you can't play with half a person, so she played with 4 more kids.
So on Wednesday, she played with 14 + 4 = 18 kids.

Thursday:
Julia played with twice as many kids as she played with on Wednesday minus 4 kids.
Twice as many as 18 is 2 * 18 = 36.
Then we subtract 4: 36 - 4 = 32 kids.

Monday:
Julia played with 8 more kids than on Tuesday.
So on Monday, she played with 14 + 8 = 22 kids.

In summary:
- Monday: 22 kids
- Tuesday: 14 kids
- Wednesday: 18 kids
- Thursday: 32 kids","Julia played with different groups of kids across four days, and the number of kids increased each day.

- Monday: 14 + 8 = 22 kids
- Tuesday: 14 kids
- Wednesday: 14 + (25% of 14) = 17.5 kids, rounded up to 18 kids
- Thursday: 2 x 18 - 4 = 32 kids

So, across the four days, Julia played with a total of 22 + 14 + 18 + 32 = 86 kids.

Therefore, the final result is 86.","Let's denote the number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday as T.

According to the information given, Julia played with 25% more kids on Wednesday than on Tuesday. So, the number of kids she played with on Wednesday is T + 25% of T = T + 0.25T = 1.25T.

On Thursday, she played with twice as many kids as she played with on Wednesday minus 4 kids. So, the number of kids she played with on Thursday is 2(1.25T) - 4 = 2.5T - 4.

We know that Julia played with 8 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday. So, the number of kids she played with on Monday is T + 8.

Now, let's find the total number of kids Julia played with from Monday to Thursday:

Monday: T + 8
Tuesday: T
Wednesday: 1.25T
Thursday: 2.5T - 4

Total = (T + 8) + T + (1.25T) + (2.5T - 4)
Total = 2T + 8 + 1.25T + 2.5T - 4
Total = 5.75T - 4

Now, let's find the value of T:

Total = 5.75T - 4
5.75T = Total + 4
5.75T = 5.75T + 4
5.75T = 9.75T

Since T cannot be 0 (because Julia played with kids on Tuesday), we divide both sides by 5.75 to solve for T:

T = 9.75T / 5.75
T = 1.75

Now that we have the value of T, we can find the number of kids Julia played with on each day:

Monday: T + 8 = 1.75 + 8 = 9.75
Tuesday: T = 1.75
Wednesday: 1.25T = 1.25 * 1.75 = 2.125
Thursday: 2.5T - 4 = 2.5 * 1.75 - 4 = 4.375 - 4 = 0.375

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6
So on Friday, she played with 30 + 6 = 36 kids.

On Saturday, she played with 30% fewer kids than on Friday. To find out how many kids that is, we calculate 30% of 36 and subtract it from 36:
30% of 36 = 0.30 * 36 = 10.8
Since we can't have a fraction of a kid, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round down to 10 (since it's closer to 10.8 than to 11).

How many minutes did the machine work yesterday, including downtime?","Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts at a rate of 1 shirt every 2 minutes. Therefore, the time taken to make the shirts (excluding downtime) would be:

9 shirts * 2 minutes/shirt = 18 minutes

Including the 20-minute downtime period, the total time the machine worked yesterday would be:

18 minutes (production time) + 20 minutes (downtime) = 38 minutes

So, the machine worked for 38 minutes yesterday, including downtime.","The machine worked for 62 minutes yesterday.

This can be broken down as follows:
9 shirts / 1 shirt per 2 minutes = 18 production minutes
Add the downtime of 20 minutes, so 18 + 20 = 38 minutes
But there's also the time it took to make the last shirt, which wasn't accounted for above. This adds 2 more minutes: 38 + 2 = 40 minutes

829,"Mary is baking a cake that requires an increase in the original recipe's ingredients. The original recipe calls for 8 cups of flour, 10 cups of sugar, 6 cups of milk, and 4 cups of butter. Mary decides to double the amount of flour and add 50% more sugar. 

If Mary already put in 3 cups of sugar, how many more cups of sugar does she need to add? And, as a result of this change, how much milk and butter should she add proportionally?","First, let's calculate the new amount of sugar Mary needs for her cake. The original recipe calls for 10 cups of sugar, and she wants to add 50% more. To find 50% of 10 cups, we multiply 10 by 0.5:

10 cups * 0.5 = 5 cups

So, Mary needs to add 5 cups to the original 10 cups to get the new amount of sugar required:

10 cups + 5 cups = 15 cups

Mary has already added 3 cups of sugar, so she needs to add the remaining amount to reach 15 cups:

15 cups - 3 cups = 12 cups

Mary needs to add 12 more cups of sugar.

Now, let's determine the proportional amounts of milk and butter. Since Mary is doubling the amount of flour, we can assume she wants to double the entire recipe. The original recipe calls for 6 cups of milk and 4 cups of butter. If we double these amounts, we get:

Milk: 6 cups * 2 = 12 cups
Butter: 4 cups * 2 = 8 cups

So, Mary should add 12 cups of milk and 8 cups of butter to keep the proportions consistent with the doubled amount of flour.","Mary needs to add another 7 cups of sugar.

By doubling the flour, the new flour amount is 16 cups. With the additional 50% of sugar, we get 10 cups + (10 cups x 0.5), which equals 15 cups of sugar in total. As Mary already added 3 cups, she has to add 15 - 3 = 12 cups more.

For the milk and butter, we maintain the original 1:0.5 ratio. Hence, if the new flour amount is 16 cups, Mary should add 8 cups of milk and 4 cups of butter.

The final result is 12.","First, let's calculate the new amount of sugar Mary needs to add.

The original recipe calls for 10 cups of sugar. Mary decides to add 50% more sugar, so she will add 50% of 10 cups.

50% of 10 cups = 0.50 * 10 cups = 5 cups

Now, let's add the 5 cups of sugar to the original 10 cups to get the new total:

10 cups (original) + 5 cups (additional) = 15 cups (new total)

Mary has already put in 3 cups of sugar, so we need to subtract that from the new total to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add:

15 cups (new total) - 3 cups (already added) = 12 cups (more sugar needed)

Now, let's calculate the new amounts of milk and butter Mary should add proportionally.

The original recipe calls for 6 cups of milk and 4 cups of butter. We need to find out what 50% of these amounts is and then add that to the original amounts.

For milk:

50% of 6 cups = 0.50 * 6 cups = 3 cups

For butter:

50% of 4 cups = 0.50 * 4 cups = 2 cups

Now, let's add the additional milk and butter to the original amounts:

Milk: 6 cups (original) + 3 cups (additional) = 9 cups (new total)
Butter: 4 cups (original) + 2 cups (additional) = 6 cups (new total)

So, Mary needs to add 12 more cups of sugar, 3 more cups of milk, and 2 more cups of butter.",12,12,12.
830,"The school is planning a field trip. The school has 84 classrooms with different numbers of students in each classroom. 95 school buses are available for transportation, with each bus having a maximum capacity of 118 seats. However, only 80% of students have decided to attend the field trip. Additionally, each school bus can only be filled up to 90% capacity to maintain certain safety measures. How many students are in the school?","To find out the number of students in the school, we first need to calculate the total number of students who can be transported on the school buses, considering the buses can only be filled up to 90% capacity.

Each bus has a maximum capacity of 118 seats, but only 90% of those seats can be used. So, the number of students that can be transported per bus is:
90% of 118 = 0.9 * 118 = 106.2

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 106 students per bus.

Now, we have 95 buses available, so the total number of students that can be transported is:
95 buses * 106 students/bus = 10070 students

However, only 80% of the students have decided to attend the field trip, so the number of students attending the field trip is:
80% of total students = 0.8 * total students

We know that the number of students attending the field trip is equal to the number of students that can be transported, which is 10070. So we can set up the equation:
0.8 * total students = 10070

Now we solve for the total number of students:
total students = 10070 / 0.8
total students = 12587.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 12588 students in the school.","There are several steps to solve this problem:

1. Calculate the maximum number of students each bus can hold while maintaining the safety measure: 0.90 x 118 = 106.2 seats.

2. Find out the total maximum capacity of all buses: 95 buses x 106 seats = 9990.

3. Multiply the total capacity by the attendance percentage: 0.80 x 9990 = 7992 students.

The school has approximately **8000** students.","First, let's calculate the maximum number of students each bus can carry at 90% capacity:

90% of 118 seats = 0.90 * 118 = 106.2 seats

Since we can't have a fraction of a seat, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 106 seats per bus.

Now, let's calculate the total number of seats available on all buses:

106 seats/bus * 95 buses = 9540 seats

Next, we need to find out how many students have decided to attend the field trip. Since only 80% of students are attending, we'll multiply the total number of seats by 80%:

9540 seats * 0.80 = 7632 students

Now we know that 7632 students are attending the field trip. To find the total number of students in the school, we divide the number of students attending by the percentage of students attending:

7632 students / 0.80 = 9540 students

So, there are 9540 students in the school.",8000,9540,12588

1. Jerry starts with 3 action figures.
2. On Monday, he adds 4 and removes 2, so he has 3 + 4 - 2 = 5 action figures.
3. On Wednesday, he adds 5 more and removes 3, so he has 5 + 5 - 3 = 7 action figures.
4. On Friday, he receives 8 more, so he has 7 + 8 = 15 action figures.
5. He decides to give away 25% of the action figures on the shelf. 25% of 15 is 0.25 * 15 = 3.75, which we can round to 4 action figures (since he can't give away a fraction of an action figure).

So, after giving away 4 action figures, Jerry has 15 - 4 = 11 action figures left on the shelf.","Jerry started with 3 action figures.

On Monday, he added 4 and removed 2, leaving him with 5 action figures.

On Wednesday, he added 5 and removed 3, resulting in 7 action figures on the shelf.

By Friday evening, Jerry had 8 more, making it 15 action figures. 

Since Jerry gave away a quarter of his collection, we multiply 15 by 0.25 to find the number to remove: 15 * 0.25 = 3.75. Knowing that we can't give away a fraction of a figure, we round down and remove 3 action figures, leaving Jerry with 12 action figures. 

Therefore, the final result is **twelve**.","Let's calculate the number of action figures Jerry has on the shelf at each point in time:

Monday: Jerry starts with 3 action figures. He adds 4 action figures, so he has 3 + 4 = 7 action figures. Then he removes 2 of the old ones, so he has 7 - 2 = 5 action figures.

Wednesday: Jerry adds another 5 action figures, so he has 5 + 5 = 10 action figures. Then he removes 3, so he has 10 - 3 = 7 action figures.

Friday: Jerry receives a gift of 8 more action figures, so he has 7 + 8 = 15 action figures.

We know there are 200 bottles in total, and we can subtract the number of regular and diet soda bottles from this total to find the number of energy soda bottles.

Total bottles of soda = 200
Bottles of regular soda = 55
Bottles of diet soda = 40

Bottles of energy soda = Total bottles of soda - (Bottles of regular soda + Bottles of diet soda)
Bottles of energy soda = 200 - (55 + 40)
Bottles of energy soda = 200 - 95
Bottles of energy soda = 105

Now that we know there are 105 bottles of energy soda, we can determine how many complete packs of 3 can be made.

Number of complete packs = Bottles of energy soda / 3
Number of complete packs = 105 / 3
Number of complete packs = 35

So, they can create 35 complete packs of energy soda.

Since each pack contains 3 bottles, we can calculate the number of bottles used in the packs:

Bottles used in packs = Number of complete packs * 3
Bottles used in packs = 35 * 3
Bottles used in packs = 105

Since all 105 bottles of energy soda are used to create the packs, there will be no bottles of energy soda left.

The number of bottles of each type of soda left will be:
- Regular soda: 55 (no change)
- Diet soda: 40 (no change)
- Energy soda: 0 (all used in packs)","Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. We know that there are 200 bottles of soda in total. We are given two types of these bottles: 55 regular soda bottles and 40 diet soda bottles. To find out the number of energy soda bottles, we subtract the sum of these from the total: 

200 - (55 + 40) = 105 energy soda bottles. 

2. The question states that the energy soda bottles are to be sold in packs of 3. We can divide the total number of energy soda bottles by 3 to find the number of complete packs: 

105 / 3 = 35 complete packs of energy soda.

The store can create 35 packs, and they will have 55 bottles of regular soda and 40 bottles of diet soda left. 

The final result: 35.","First, let's find out how many bottles of energy soda there are. Since we know the total number of bottles is 200, and we have 55 bottles of regular soda and 40 bottles of diet soda, we can subtract these from the total to find the number of energy soda bottles:

200 (total bottles) - 55 (regular soda) - 40 (diet soda) = 105 bottles of energy soda.

Now, let's find out how many complete packs of energy soda the store can create. Since each pack contains 3 bottles, we divide the number of energy soda bottles by 3:

105 bottles ÷ 3 bottles/pack = 35 packs.

How many total sacks of each type of fruit (ripe oranges, unripe oranges, ripe apples, unripe apples) will the farm have after 26 days of harvest?","To calculate the total sacks of each type of fruit after 26 days, we need to separate the calculation for oranges and apples due to the varying rates for oranges on odd and even days.

For oranges:
- There are 13 odd-numbered days and 13 even-numbered days in a 26-day period.
- On odd-numbered days, they collect 32 sacks of ripe oranges and 46 sacks of unripe oranges.
- On even-numbered days, they collect 28 sacks of ripe oranges and 52 sacks of unripe oranges.

For ripe oranges:
- On odd days: 13 days * 32 sacks/day = 416 sacks
- On even days: 13 days * 28 sacks/day = 364 sacks
- Total ripe oranges: 416 sacks + 364 sacks = 780 sacks

For unripe oranges:
- On odd days: 13 days * 46 sacks/day = 598 sacks
- On even days: 13 days * 52 sacks/day = 676 sacks
- Total unripe oranges: 598 sacks + 676 sacks = 1274 sacks

For apples:

Next, we multiply the daily harvest rates by the number of days to get the total harvest over 26 days. For the odd-numbered day orange harvest rate of 78 sacks/day, we get 78 sacks/day * 13 odd-numbered days = 1014 sacks. For the even-numbered day orange harvest rate of 80 sacks/day, we get 80 sacks/day * 13 even-numbered days = 1040 sacks. Adding these together, we get 1014 + 1040 = 2054 sacks of oranges after 26 days. Similarly, we can calculate that there will be 80 * 26 = 1040 sacks of apples.

The final result is 2794.","First, let's calculate the total number of sacks of each type of fruit the farm will have after 26 days of harvest.

For ripe oranges:
On odd-numbered days, they collect 32 sacks.
On even-numbered days, they collect 28 sacks.

Since there are 26 days in total, we need to find out how many of those days are odd-numbered and how many are even-numbered.

There are 13 odd-numbered days (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25) and 13 even-numbered days (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26).

So, for ripe oranges, the total number of sacks after 26 days is:
(13 odd-numbered days * 32 sacks/day) + (13 even-numbered days * 28 sacks/day) = 416 sacks

For unripe oranges:
On odd-numbered days, they collect 46 sacks.
On even-numbered days, they collect 52 sacks.

Since there are 26 days in total, we need to find out how many of those days are odd-numbered and how many are even-numbered.

There are 13 odd-numbered days and 13 even-numbered days.

So, for unripe oranges, the total number of sacks after 26 days is:
(13 odd-numbered days * 46 sacks/day) + (13 even-numbered days * 52 sacks/day) = 638 sacks

For ripe apples:
They collect 50 sacks daily, regardless of the day.

So, for ripe apples, the total number of sacks after 26 days is:
50 sacks/day * 26 days = 1300 sacks

For unripe apples:
They collect 30 sacks daily, regardless of the day.

So, for unripe apples, the total number of sacks after 26 days is:
30 sacks/day * 26 days = 780 sacks

In summary, the total number of sacks of each type of fruit after 26 days of harvest is:
- Ripe oranges: 416 sacks
- Unripe oranges: 638 sacks
- Ripe apples: 1300 sacks
- Unripe apples: 780",2794,416 638 1300 780,2634

How much money did they make from selling the merchandise during the Arkansas game?","To calculate the total money made from selling the merchandise during the Arkansas game, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For t-shirts:
42 t-shirts * $98 per t-shirt = $4116

For hats:
32 hats * $45 per hat = $1440

For scarves:
15 scarves * $60 per scarf = $900

Now, we add up the totals for each item to get the total money made:
$4116 (t-shirts) + $1440 (hats) + $900 (scarves) = $6456

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $6456 from selling the merchandise during the Arkansas game.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game: 42 t-shirts x $98/t-shirt = $4116.

2. Calculate the total revenue from hats: 32 hats x $45/hat = $1440.

3. Calculate the total revenue from scarves: 15 scarves x $60/scarf = $900.

4. Total revenue from the Arkansas game = $4116 + $1440 + $900 = $6456

If there were 128 dollars in her wallet initially, how much money does she have left after paying for the items and the sales tax?","First, we need to calculate the total amount of sales tax Olivia has to pay on her $38 purchase. The sales tax rate is 8%, so we calculate the sales tax as follows:

Sales tax = (Sales tax rate) x (Amount spent)
Sales tax = 0.08 x $38
Sales tax = $3.04

Now, we add the sales tax to the amount spent to find the total amount Olivia has to pay:

Total amount paid = Amount spent + Sales tax
Total amount paid = $38 + $3.04
Total amount paid = $41.04

Finally, we subtract the total amount paid from the initial amount in Olivia's wallet to find out how much money she has left:

Money left = Initial amount in wallet - Total amount paid
Money left = $128 - $41.04
Money left = $86.96

Additionally, if the bird families flying to Africa spend 7 days on their journey, those flying to Asia need 14 days, those migrating to South America take 10 days, how long would the cumulative migration time be for all bird families combined?","First, let's find out how many bird families stayed near the Rocky Mountains. We know that 200 bird families are preparing to migrate and some of them flew to different continents:

60 bird families flew to Africa
95 bird families flew to Asia
30 bird families migrated to South America

To find out how many stayed, we add up the ones that left and subtract from the total:

60 (Africa) + 95 (Asia) + 30 (South America) = 185 bird families migrated

Now we subtract the number of families that migrated from the total number of families:

200 (total families) - 185 (migrated families) = 15 bird families stayed near the Rocky Mountains.

Next, let's calculate the cumulative migration time for all bird families combined:

60 bird families to Africa x 7 days = 420 days
95 bird families to Asia x 14 days = 1330 days
30 bird families to South America x 10 days = 300 days

Now we add up all the days:

1. Of the 200 bird families, we know the destination of 185 bird families:
  - 60 flew to Africa
  - 95 flew to Asia
  - 30 migrated to South America

2. We need to determine the number of bird families that remained in North America.
200 - 185 = 15 bird families remained near the Rocky Mountains.

3. Now, let's calculate the total migration time:
  - Journey to Africa: 60 families * 7 days = 420 days
  - Journey to Asia: 95 families * 14 days = 1,330 days
  - Journey to South America: 30 families * 10 days = 300 days

Seventeen hundred and fifty.","First, let's find out how many bird families remained in North America.

We know that 60 bird families flew to Africa, 95 flew to Asia, and 30 migrated to South America. The rest remained in North America.

To find out how many bird families remained, we subtract the number of bird families that flew to Africa, Asia, and South America from the total number of bird families.

Total number of bird families = 200
Number of bird families that flew to Africa = 60
Number of bird families that flew to Asia = 95
Number of bird families that migrated to South America = 30

Number of bird families that remained in North America = Total number of bird families - (Number of bird families that flew to Africa + Number of bird families that flew to Asia + Number of bird families that migrated to South America)

Number of bird families that remained in North America = 200 - (60 + 95 + 30)
Number of bird families that remained in North America = 200 - 195
Number of bird families that remained in North America = 5

We know that the bird families flying to Africa spend 7 days on their journey, those flying to Asia need 14 days, and those migrating to South America take 10 days.

To find the cumulative migration time, we multiply the number of bird families by the days they spend on their journey and then add the results together.

Cumulative migration time for bird families flying to Africa = Number of bird families flying to Africa * Days spent on journey
Cumulative migration time for bird families flying to Africa = 60 * 7
Cumulative migration time for bird families flying to Africa = 420 days

Cumulative migration time for bird families flying to Asia = Number of bird families flying to Asia * Days spent on journey
Cumulative migration time for bird families flying to Asia = 95 * 14
Cumulative migration time for bird families flying to Asia = 1330 days

Cumulative migration time for bird families migrating to South America = Number of bird families migrating to South America * Days spent on journey
Cumulative migration time for bird families migrating to South America = 30 * 10
Cumulative migration time for bird families migrating to South America = 300 days

How many necklaces can she make, and how many of each type of bead will be used in each necklace?","To determine how many necklaces Emily can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of round beads and twice the number of square beads, since the pattern is one round bead to two square beads.

Emily has 48 round beads and 36 square beads. Since the pattern is one round bead to two square beads, we need to consider 2 * 36 = 72 for the square beads to find the GCD.

Now, let's find the GCD of 48 and 72.

The factors of 48 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48.
The factors of 72 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.

Now, let's calculate how many necklaces she can make:

For round beads: 48 / 24 = 2 necklaces.
For square beads: 36 / (24 / 2) = 36 / 12 = 3 necklaces.

Since the limiting factor is the round beads (she can only make 2 necklaces with the round beads), Emily can make 2 necklaces.

3. Calculate the earnings from hats: 32 x 215 = $6880

4. Calculate the earnings from limited-edition jackets: 245 x 45 = $10925

5. Find the total earnings by adding up the earnings from all items: 4838 + 25680 + 6880 + 10925 = $48323

Therefore, the Razorback shop made **$48323** during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.","First, let's calculate the total amount of money made from each type of item:

T-shirts: 74 t-shirts * $67/t-shirt = $4978
Jerseys: 156 jerseys * $165/jersey = $25890
Hats: 215 hats * $32/hat = $6880
Limited edition jackets: 45 jackets * $245/jacket = $11025

Now, let's add up all the amounts to find the total:

Total = $4978 (from t-shirts) + $25890 (from jerseys) + $6880 (from hats) + $11025 (from limited edition jackets)
Total = $4978 + $25890 + $6880 + $11025
Total = $4978 + $33783
Total = $38761

So, the Razorback shop made a total of $38,761 from selling all these items.",48323,38761,48603

If there were 709 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many bird families were left near the mountain?,"If there were initially 709 bird families living near the mountain and 472 bird families flew away for the winter, then the number of bird families left near the mountain would be:

709 (initial number of bird families) - 472 (number of bird families that flew away) = 237 bird families left near the mountain.","To solve the word problem, we need to subtract the number of birds that migrated from the initial total.

Starting with 709 bird families, 472 families flew away.

Therefore, 709 - 472 = 237 bird families were left near the mountain.

Two hundred and thirty-seven.","If there were initially 709 bird families living near the mountain and 472 bird families flew away for the winter, then the number of bird families left near the mountain would be:

If he had started with 80 pieces of candy, how many pieces of candy are left in each bag now?","Frank started with 80 pieces of candy and divided them equally into 4 bags. 

To find out how many pieces of candy were in each bag initially, we divide the total number of candies by the number of bags:
80 pieces / 4 bags = 20 pieces per bag

Frank then took out 2.5 pieces of candy from each bag to give to his friends. 

To find out how many pieces of candy are left in each bag, we subtract the number of candies he took out from the initial amount in each bag:
20 pieces - 2.5 pieces = 17.5 pieces

So, there are 17.5 pieces of candy left in each bag now.","Let's solve this problem step by step.

Frank started with 80 pieces of candy, which he divided equally into 4 bags. We know that after some calculations, there were 17.5 pieces of candy left in each bag. 

The final result is 17.5.

17.5","Frank started with 80 pieces of candy and put them equally into 4 bags. This means that each bag had 80 / 4 = 20 pieces of candy.

After taking out 2.5 pieces of candy from each bag, the number of pieces of candy left in each bag is:

20 - 2.5 = 17.5

However, since you can't have a fraction of a piece of candy, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number. Since 17.5 is closer to 18 than to 17, we can say that each bag now has 18 pieces of candy left.",17.5,18,17.5
857,"Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground, and now has 17 marbles. Charlie has 4 times as many marbles as Doug. How many marbles does each person have now?","Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Ed had before he lost 20 of them. Since Ed now has 17 marbles after losing 20, he must have had 17 + 20 marbles before losing them. 

17 + 20 = 37 marbles

So, Ed originally had 37 marbles.

We are told that Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. So, to find out how many marbles Doug had, we subtract 12 from the number of marbles Ed had originally.

37 (Ed's original marbles) - 12 = 25 marbles

So, Doug had 25 marbles.

Now, let's find out how many marbles Charlie has. Charlie has 4 times as many marbles as Doug.

4 * 25 (Doug's marbles) = 100 marbles

So, Charlie has 100 marbles.

In summary:
- Ed now has 17 marbles (after losing 20).
- Doug has 25 marbles.
- Charlie has 100 marbles.","Let's first find out how many marbles Ed has lost: 20 marbles.

Ed had 17 + 20 = 37 marbles before he lost them.

Doug has 37 - 12 = 25 marbles.

Charlie has 25 x 4 = 100 marbles.

Therefore, Ed has 17 marbles, Doug has 25 marbles, and Charlie has 100 marbles.
100 marbles.","Let's denote the number of marbles Doug has as D. According to the information given, Ed has 12 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has D + 12 marbles.

After losing 20 marbles, Ed has D + 12 - 20 = D + 4 marbles. We know that after losing these marbles, Ed has 17 marbles, so we can set up the equation:

D + 4 = 17

Now, let's solve for D:

D = 17 - 4
D = 13

So, Doug has 13 marbles. Since Charlie has 4 times as many marbles as Doug, Charlie has 4 * 13 = 52 marbles.

Now, let's find out how many marbles each person has now:

- Doug has 13 marbles.
- Ed has D + 12 = 13 + 12 = 25 marbles.

The total number of kids in these age groups are 450,000, 600,000, and 300,000 respectively. If the rest of the kids in each age group stay at home, how many more kids stayed home compared to those who went to the camps? Calculate the difference in the number of kids attending camp and staying home for each age group, and then find the total difference across all age groups.","First, let's calculate the number of kids who attend camps in each age group:

For kids aged 10-12:
12% of 450,000 = 0.12 * 450,000 = 54,000 kids attend camp.

For kids aged 13-15:
20% of 600,000 = 0.20 * 600,000 = 120,000 kids attend camp.

For kids aged 16-18:
5% of 300,000 = 0.05 * 300,000 = 15,000 kids attend camp.

Now, let's calculate the number of kids who stay at home in each age group:

For kids aged 10-12:
450,000 - 54,000 = 396,000 kids stay at home.

For kids aged 13-15:
600,000 - 120,000 = 480,000 kids stay at home.

For kids aged 16-18:
300,000 - 15,000 = 285,000 kids stay at home.

Next, we'll find the difference in the number of kids attending camp and staying home for each age group:

For kids aged 10-12:
396,000 (home) - 54,000 (camp) = 342,000 more kids stayed home.

For kids aged 13-15:
480,000 (home) - 120,000 (camp) = 360,000 more kids stayed home.

For kids aged 16-18:
285,000 (home) - 15,000 (camp) = 270,000 more kids stayed home.

Finally, we'll find the total difference across all age groups by adding the differences for each age group:

342,000 (10-12) + 360,000 (13-15) + 270,000 (16-18) = 972,000 more kids stayed home compared to those who went to the camps.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the number of kids who attended camps in each age group: 
- 12% of 450,000 is 0.12 x 450,000 = 54,000
- 20% of 600,000 is 0.20 x 600,000 = 120,000
- 5% of 300,000 is 0.05 x 300,000 = 15,000

2. Find the number of kids who stayed at home in each age group by subtracting the number of camp attendees from the total population:
- 450,000 - 54,000 = 396,000 for the 10-12 age group
- 600,000 - 120,000 = 480,000 for the 13-15 age group
- 300,000 - 15,000 = 285,000 for the 16-18 age group

3. Calculate the total difference across all age groups: 
- 396,000 + 480,000 + 285,000 = 1,161,000 kids stayed home, while 174,000 went to camp.

In the second semester, however, he used 3 times as many erasers as crayons. By the end of the school year, he had used a total of 265 crayons and 146 erasers. How many more erasers than crayons did he have left?","Let's first calculate how many crayons and erasers Paul had left after using some during the school year.

Paul started with 601 crayons and used 265 of them. So, he had:
601 - 265 = 336 crayons left.

Paul started with 406 erasers and used 146 of them. So, he had:
406 - 146 = 260 erasers left.

Now, let's find out how many more erasers than crayons he had left:
260 erasers - 336 crayons = -76

This means Paul had 76 fewer erasers than crayons left, not more. If you're looking for the absolute difference regardless of which is more, it's 76. However, if you're strictly asking for how many more erasers than crayons, the answer would be 0, since he does not have more erasers than crayons.","In the first semester, Paul used 2 × 146 erasers = 292 crayons. In the second semester, he used 3 × 292 crayons = 876 erasers. The total number of crayons used in the whole school year is 292 crayons + 265 crayons = 557 crayons. The total number of erasers used is 146 + 876 = 1022. 

Paul has 601 crayons - 557 crayons = 44 crayons left. He has 406 erasers - 1022 erasers = -616 erasers left (or 616 in deficit).

-312.","Let's denote the number of erasers Paul used in the first semester as E1 and the number of crayons he used in the second semester as C2.

According to the information given, Paul used twice as many crayons as erasers in the first semester, so we can write:
C1 = 2E1

We also know that in the second semester, he used 3 times as many erasers as crayons, so we can write:
E2 = 3C2

We are told that by the end of the school year, he had used a total of 265 crayons and 146 erasers. So we can write:
C1 + C2 = 265
E1 + E2 = 146

Now we can substitute the expression for C1 into the equation for C1 + C2:
2E1 + C2 = 265

We also know that E2 = 3C2, so we can substitute this into the equation for E1 + E2:
E1 + 3C2 = 146

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) 2E1 + C2 = 265
2) E1 + 3C2 = 146

We can solve this system by expressing C2 in terms of E1 and then substituting that back into the first equation.

From the second equation, we can express C2 in terms of E1:
3C2 = 146 - E1
C2 = (146 - E1) / 3

Now we can substitute this expression for C2 back into the first equation:
2E1 + ((146 - E1) / 3) = 265

Now we need to solve for E1. First, let's distribute the 2 in the first term:
2E1 + (146 - E1) = 265
2E1 + 146 - E1 = 265

Now let's combine like terms:
3E1 + 146 = 265

Now let's solve for E1:
3E1 = 265 - 146
3E1 = 119
E1 = 119 / 3
E1 = 39.666666666666666 (approximately)

Since E1 must be a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number:
E1 = 40

If some of the flowers have bloomed and some have not, and the ratio of bloomed to unbloomed flowers is 3:2, how many flowers of each type are there in total?","First, let's find the total number of flowers in all the gardens. Since there are 3,256 pots in each garden and 15 gardens, we multiply these two numbers to find the total number of pots:

3,256 pots/garden * 15 gardens = 48,840 pots

Each pot has 45 flowers, so to find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of pots by the number of flowers per pot:

48,840 pots * 45 flowers/pot = 2,197,800 flowers

Now, we know the ratio of bloomed to unbloomed flowers is 3:2. This means that for every 3 bloomed flowers, there are 2 unbloomed flowers. To find out how many of each type there are, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the sum of the parts of the ratio (3 + 2 = 5 parts).

First, we find the value of one part:

2,197,800 flowers / 5 parts = 439,560 flowers/part

Now, we can find the number of bloomed and unbloomed flowers:

Bloomed flowers (3 parts):
3 parts * 439,560 flowers/part = 1,318,680 bloomed flowers

Unbloomed flowers (2 parts):
2 parts * 439,560 flowers/part = 879,120 unbloomed flowers

So, there are 1,318,680 bloomed flowers and 879,120 unbloomed flowers in total.","There are 18936 flowers in total, split evenly into 9468 bloomed and 9468 unbloomed flowers. 

The answer is 18936.","First, let's find the total number of flowers in each garden. Since there are 3,256 pots in each garden and each pot has 45 flowers, we can calculate the total number of flowers in each garden by multiplying the number of pots by the number of flowers per pot:

Total flowers per garden = 3,256 pots/garden * 45 flowers/pot
Total flowers per garden = 146,520 flowers/garden

Now, let's find the total number of flowers in all gardens:

Total flowers in all gardens = 146,520 flowers/garden * 15 gardens
Total flowers in all gardens = 2,200,080 flowers

Next, we need to find the total number of bloomed and unbloomed flowers. Since the ratio of bloomed to unbloomed flowers is 3:2, we can set up a proportion to find the number of each type:

3/2 = bloomed flowers / unbloomed flowers

To find the number of unbloomed flowers, we can multiply the total number of flowers by the ratio of unbloomed flowers to the total number of flowers:

Unbloomed flowers = 2,200,080 flowers * (2/5)
Unbloomed flowers = 2,200,080 flowers * 0.4
Unbloomed flowers = 928,036 flowers

Now, we can find the number of bloomed flowers by subtracting the number of unbloomed flowers from the total number of flowers:

Bloomed flowers = Total flowers - Unbloomed flowers
Bloomed flowers = 2,200,080 flowers - 928,036 flowers
Bloomed flowers = 1,272,044 flowers

However, she gave 12% of her remaining cards to her brother. After all these transactions, how many cards does Nell have left?","Let's calculate step by step:

1. Nell gave 4,876 of her cards to Jeff:
15,350 (initial number of cards) - 4,876 (cards given to Jeff) = 10,474 (cards left after giving to Jeff)

2. Nell bought 3,129 more cards from a collector:
10,474 (cards left after giving to Jeff) + 3,129 (cards bought) = 13,603 (cards after buying more)

3. Nell gave 12% of her remaining cards to her brother:
12% of 13,603 = 0.12 * 13,603 = 1,632.36

Since Nell can't give a fraction of a card, we'll round the number of cards given to her brother to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round down because you can't give away part of a card.

So, Nell gives 1,632 cards to her brother.

4. Calculate the final number of cards Nell has left:

What is the ratio and percentage of green and yellow peaches relative to the total number of peaches in the basket?","First, let's find the total number of peaches in the basket by adding all the peaches together:

Total peaches = Red peaches + Yellow peaches + Green peaches + Orange peaches
Total peaches = 8 + 14 + 6 + 4
Total peaches = 32

Now, let's find the ratio of green peaches to the total number of peaches:

Green peaches : Total peaches = 6 : 32

To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

Simplified ratio (Green peaches : Total peaches) = (6 ÷ 2) : (32 ÷ 2)
Simplified ratio (Green peaches : Total peaches) = 3 : 16

Next, let's find the ratio of yellow peaches to the total number of peaches:

Yellow peaches : Total peaches = 14 : 32

To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

Simplified ratio (Yellow peaches : Total peaches) = (14 ÷ 2) : (32 ÷ 2)
Simplified ratio (Yellow peaches : Total peaches) = 7 : 16

Now, let's calculate the percentage of green peaches relative to the total number of peaches:

Percentage of Green peaches = (Green peaches / Total peaches) × 100
Percentage of Green peaches = (6 / 32) × 100
Percentage of Green peaches = 0.1875 × 100
Percentage of Green peaches = 18.75%

And the percentage of yellow peaches relative to the total number of peaches:

Percentage of Yellow peaches = (Yellow peaches / Total peaches) × 100
Percentage of Yellow peaches = (14 / 32) × 100
Percentage of Yellow peaches = 0.4375 × 100
Percentage of Yellow peaches = 43.75%

In summary:
- The ratio of green peaches to the total number of peaches is 3:16, and they make up 18.75% of the total.

To find out how many push-ups Karen did, we first need to find the average number of push-ups done by Zachary, Melanie, and David. The total number of push-ups done by the three of them is:
Total = Zachary's push-ups + Melanie's push-ups + David's push-ups
Total = 51 + 95 + 73 = 219 push-ups.

The average number of push-ups is the total divided by 3:
Average = Total / 3 = 219 / 3 = 73 push-ups.

Karen did 5 less than the average, so she did:
Karen's push-ups = Average - 5 = 73 - 5 = 68 push-ups.

John did 4 push-ups less than David, so he did:
John's push-ups = David's push-ups - 4 = 73 - 4 = 69 push-ups.

Now, we can find the total number of push-ups done by John, Melanie, and Karen:
Total = John's push-ups + Melanie's push-ups + Karen's push-ups
Total = 69 + 95 + 68 = 232 push-ups.

Therefore, John, Melanie, and Karen did a total of 232 push-ups.","Let's solve the multi-step word problem. 

Step 1: We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups, so x = 51. 

Step 2: Melanie did 2 * Zachary's push-ups - 7, which is 2 * 51 - 7 = 94 - 7 = 87 push-ups. 

Step 3: David did 22 more than Zachary, so 51 + 22 = 73 push-ups. 

Step 4: The average number of push-ups between Zachary, Melanie, and David is (51 + 87 + 73) / 3 = 75 push-ups. 

Step 5: Karen did 5 less than this average, so she did 75 - 5 = 70 push-ups. 

Step 6: John did 4 less than David, so he did 73 - 4 = 69 push-ups. 

The total number of push-ups done by John, Melanie, and Karen is 69 + 87 + 70 = **126**.

Therefore, the final result is 126.","Let's start by finding out how many push-ups Melanie did. Since Melanie did twice as many push-ups as Zachary minus 7, we can set up the following equation:

Melanie's push-ups = 2 * Zachary's push-ups - 7

We know Zachary did 51 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

Melanie's push-ups = 2 * 51 - 7
Melanie's push-ups = 102 - 7
Melanie's push-ups = 95

Now we know Melanie did 95 push-ups.

Next, we find out how many push-ups David did. David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can set up another equation:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 22

We know Zachary did 51 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

David's push-ups = 51 + 22
David's push-ups = 73

Now we know David did 73 push-ups.

Next, we find out how many push-ups Karen did. Karen did 5 less than the average number of push-ups done by Zachary, Melanie, and David. Since there are 3 people (Zachary, Melanie, and David), we can calculate the average as follows:

Average = (Zachary's push-ups + Melanie's push-ups + David's push-ups) / 3

We know Zachary did 51 push-ups, Melanie did 95 push-ups, and David did 73 push-ups, so we can plug those values into the equation:

Average = (51 + 95 + 73) / 3
Average = 229 / 3
Average = 76.33 (approximately)

Now we can find out how many push-ups Karen did by subtracting 5 from the average:

Karen's push-ups = Average - 5
Karen's push-ups = 76.33 - 5
Karen's push-ups = 71.33 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a push-up, we'll round Karen's push-ups to the nearest whole number. Since 71.33 is closer to 71 than 72, we'll round to 71.

Now we find out how many push-ups John did. John did 4 push-ups less than David, so we can set up another equation:

John's push-ups = David's push-ups - 4

We know David did 73",126,71,232
865,"Jake has x fewer peaches than Steven, and y more than Jill. Steven has z more peaches than another person, Kate, who has f peaches. If Jill has 5 peaches and Kate has twice the amount of peaches as Jill, find the number of peaches Jake has in terms of x, y, z, and f.","First, let's find out how many peaches Kate has. Since Kate has twice the amount of peaches as Jill, and Jill has 5 peaches, Kate has:

f = 2 * 5 = 10 peaches

Now, Steven has z more peaches than Kate, so Steven has:

Steven's peaches = f + z = 10 + z

Jake has x fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has:

Jake's peaches = (Steven's peaches) - x = (10 + z) - x

Jake also has y more peaches than Jill, who has 5 peaches, so Jake also has:

Jake's peaches = Jill's peaches + y = 5 + y

Since both expressions represent the number of peaches Jake has, we can set them equal to each other:

(10 + z) - x = 5 + y

Now, we want to find the number of peaches Jake has in terms of x, y, z, and f. Since we already know f is 10 (from Kate's number of peaches), we can substitute f back into the equation:

(f + z) - x = 5 + y

Jake's peaches = f + z - x = 10 + z - x

So, the number of peaches Jake has in terms of x, y, z, and f is:

Jake's peaches = f + z - x

Since we already know f is 10, we can also write it as:

Jake's peaches = 10 + z - x

This is the final expression for the number of peaches Jake has in terms of x, y, z, and f. Note that y is not needed in the final expression because it is not directly related to the number of peaches Jake has when compared to Steven and Kate.","Steven has z + f peaches. 
Jill has 5 peaches. 
So, Kate has 2 x 5 = 10 peaches. 

Therefore, Jake has f - y peaches, which is equal to 10 - y.

The final result is: 10 - y.","Let's denote the number of peaches Jake has as J, the number of peaches Steven has as S, the number of peaches Jill has as J (since we know Jill has 5 peaches), and the number of peaches Kate has as K.

According to the information given, we have the following relationships:

1. Jake has x fewer peaches than Steven, so J = S - x.
2. Jake has y more peaches than Jill, so J = J + y = 5 + y.
3. Steven has z more peaches than Kate, so S = K + z.
4. Kate has f peaches, so K = f.

Now, let's use these relationships to find the number of peaches Jake has.

From relationship 3, we have S = K + z, which means S = f + z.

Substituting this expression for S into relationship 1, we get J = (f + z) - x.

Now, let's substitute the value of S from relationship 3 into relationship 2 to find the value of J:

J = J + y = (f + z) + y.

Now we have two expressions for J:

1. J = (f + z) - x
2. J = (f + z) + y

To solve for J, we need to find a relationship between x, y, z, and f that allows us to express J in terms of these variables. However, the information given does not provide any relationship between x, y, z, and f. Without such a relationship, we cannot express J in terms of these variables.

If you can provide additional information about the relationship between x, y, z, and f, I can help you solve for J. Otherwise, without more information, we cannot determine the number of peaches Jake has.",10 - y,insufficient information,10 + z - x
866,"Baker made 56 pastries and 124 cakes. On the first day, he sold 35% of the pastries and 80% of the cakes. On the second day, he sold 2/5 of the remaining pastries and 15 more cakes. How many pastries does Baker have left?","First, let's calculate how many pastries and cakes Baker sold on the first day.

For pastries:
35% of 56 pastries = 0.35 * 56 = 19.6
Since Baker can't sell a fraction of a pastry, we'll round down to 19 pastries sold on the first day.

For cakes:
80% of 124 cakes = 0.80 * 124 = 99.2
Again, Baker can't sell a fraction of a cake, so we'll round down to 99 cakes sold on the first day.

Now let's calculate how many pastries and cakes were left after the first day.

Remaining pastries after the first day:
56 pastries - 19 pastries sold = 37 pastries

Remaining cakes after the first day:
124 cakes - 99 cakes sold = 25 cakes

On the second day, Baker sold 2/5 of the remaining pastries and 15 more cakes.

For pastries on the second day:
2/5 of 37 pastries = (2/5) * 37 = 14.8
We'll round down to 14 pastries sold on the second day.

For cakes on the second day:
Baker sold 15 more cakes.

Now let's calculate how many pastries and cakes were left after the second day.

Remaining pastries after the second day:
37 pastries - 14 pastries sold = 23 pastries

Baker has 23 pastries left.","Baker initially had 56 pastries and 124 cakes. 

On the first day, he sold 19.6 pastries (35% of 56) and 99.2 cakes (80% of 124), leaving him with 36.4 pastries and 24.8 cakes. 

The next day, he sold 14.59 pastries (2/5 of the remaining pastries) and 40.35 cakes (15 added to the remaining 24.8 cakes). 

Baker has 21.81 pastries left.

Pasteries: 22.","Let's calculate the number of pastries and cakes Baker sold on the first day.

For pastries:
35% of 56 pastries = 0.35 * 56 = 20 pastries

For cakes:
80% of 124 cakes = 0.80 * 124 = 100 cakes

Now, let's find out how many pastries and cakes Baker has left after the first day.

For pastries:
56 pastries - 20 pastries sold = 36 pastries left

For cakes:
124 cakes - 100 cakes sold = 24 cakes left

On the second day, Baker sold 2/5 of the remaining pastries and 15 more cakes.

For pastries:
2/5 of 36 pastries = (2/5) * 36 = 14.4 pastries, but since we can't sell a fraction of a pastry, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 14 pastries.

For cakes:
24 cakes left + 15 more cakes sold = 39 cakes

Now, let's find out how many pastries Baker has left after the second day.

For pastries:

867,"Anna wants to buy 6 packs of DVDs that have different prices. She has a discount coupon that gives her 25% off. After using the coupon, she spends a total of 120 dollars. If the prices of the packs are $15, $20, $25, $30, $35, and $40, determine the original price of each pack before the discount was applied.","Let's first calculate the total amount Anna would have spent without the discount. Since she spent $120 after applying a 25% discount, we can represent the original total price (before the discount) as \( x \).

The relationship between the discounted price and the original price is given by:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - (\text{Discount Percentage} \times \text{Original Price}) \]

In Anna's case, the discounted price is $120, and the discount percentage is 25%, or 0.25 in decimal form. So we have:
\[ 120 = x - (0.25 \times x) \]
\[ 120 = x - 0.25x \]
\[ 120 = 0.75x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) to find the original total price:
\[ x = \frac{120}{0.75} \]
\[ x = 160 \]

So, the original total price before the discount was applied is $160.

Now, we know the original prices of the packs are $15, $20, $25, $30, $35, and $40. Since these are already the original prices, there is no need to adjust them. Anna's total before the discount would have been the sum of these prices, which should equal the $160 we calculated.

Let's check if the sum of the given prices equals $160:
\[ 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40 = 165 \]

The sum is $165, not $160. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the prices given, as the sum of the prices does not match the calculated original total price before the discount. If the total before the discount is indeed $160, then one or more of the given prices must be incorrect. If the prices are correct, then the total spent after the discount should be different. Please double-check the details provided.","We need to find the original price of each pack before the discount is applied, knowing that the total spent after the 25% discount is $120. Here are the steps to solve this:

1: Sum up the prices of all the packs: $15 + $20 + $25 + $30 + $35 + $40 = $165

2: We know that after the 25% discount, Anna spent $120, so we'll set up an equation: 
$120 = 75% x ($165)

3: Solving for x yields x = $120 / 0.75, which equals $160

4: The original price before the discount was applied was $160.

The final result is: $160.","Let's denote the original price of each pack as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6, respectively.

We know that Anna spent a total of $120 after using the discount coupon, which gives her 25% off. This means that the total price she paid is 75% of the original price.

The total price she paid for the 6 packs is the sum of the prices of each pack after the discount:

Total price = P1 + P2 + P3 + P4 + P5 + P6

We are given the prices of each pack after the discount:

P1 = $15
P2 = $20
P3 = $25
P4 = $30
P5 = $35
P6 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total price she paid:

Total price = $15 + $20 + $25 + $30 + $35 + $40
Total price = $165

This is the total price after the discount. To find the original price, we need to multiply the total price by 1.25 (since 25% off means 75% of the original price):

Original price = Total price * 1.25
Original price = $165 * 1.25
Original price = $206.25

Now, we need to distribute this total original price among the 6 packs. Since we don't have the exact distribution, we can only give the total original price for all 6 packs.

The original price for all 6 packs is $206.25. To find the original price for each pack, we divide the total original price by the number of packs:

Original price for each pack = Total original price / Number of packs
Original price for each pack = $206.25 / 6
Original price for each pack = $34.38

So, the original price for each pack before the discount was applied is approximately $34.38.",160,$34.38,160

This appears insoluble as there are four unknowns and only one equation. However, we also know that each day's harvest is greater than zero. This provides us with four constraints: 

A > 0, B > 0, C > 0, D > 0

These constraints turn our four unknowns into four equations:

A = 1 + E
B = 2 + F
C = 3 + G
D = 4 + H

where E, F, G, and H are non-negative integers. We can substitute these into our original equation:

1 + E + 2 + F + 3 + G + 4 + H = 56

Simplifying this gives:

E + F + G + H = 48

Now, we can solve this equation by adding non-negative integers E, F, G, and H in every possible combination until we reach 48. There are only four combinations that work:

- E = F = G = H = 6
- E = 5, F = 5, G = 7, H = 6
- E = 6, F = 6, G = 6, H = 8
- E = 7, F = 6, G = 5, H = 6

Each of these combinations represents a possible outcome for the number of sacks harvested daily. 

The result is: 8
or alternatively: 6, 6, 7, 8","Let's denote the number of sacks harvested on each day as A, B, C, and D, respectively. According to the problem, the sum of the sacks harvested over the 4 days is equal to 56, so we can write the equation:

A + B + C + D = 56

We are given that each day's harvest is a whole number greater than zero, so we can express each of A, B, C, and D as a multiple of a common factor. Let's call this common factor x. Then we can write:

A = x * a
B = x * b
C = x * c
D = x * d

where a, b, c, and d are whole numbers greater than zero.

Now we can substitute these expressions into the equation:

x * a + x * b + x * c + x * d = 56

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by x:

a + b + c + d = 56 / x

Now we have an equation with a common factor on one side and a sum of terms on the other side. To solve for the common factor, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by the sum of the terms, gives us 56.

Since we are looking for a whole number greater than zero, we can start by dividing 56 by the smallest whole number greater than zero, which is 1. So we divide 56 by 1:

56 ÷ 1 = 56

Now we have a number that, when multiplied by the sum of the terms, gives us 56. However, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by the sum of the terms, gives us 56 and is also a whole number greater than zero. Since 56 is the smallest whole number greater than zero, it is the only number that satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the common factor x is 56, and the number of sacks harvested on each day is:

A = 56 * a
B = 56 * b
C = 56 * c
D = 56 * d

Now we need to find the values of a, b, c, and d such that the sum of the terms is equal to 56. Since we are looking for whole numbers, we can try dividing 56 by each of the terms to see if we get a whole number.

Let's start with a:

56 ÷ a = 1 (since 56 ÷ 1 = 56, and 1 is a whole number)

Now let's try b:

56 ÷ b = 2 (since 56 ÷ 2",8,56,56
875,"At a grocery store, there are 4 brands of soda. In the diet soda section, the store had 5 bottles for the first brand, 6 bottles for the second brand, 9 bottles for the third brand, and 10 bottles for the fourth brand. For regular soda, they had 50% more bottles than the diet soda for the first brand, 80% more bottles for the second brand, 40% more bottles than diet soda for the third brand, and 100% more bottles for the fourth brand. Calculate the total number of regular soda bottles for each brand.","Let's calculate the number of regular soda bottles for each brand based on the given percentages:

1. For the first brand:
Diet soda bottles = 5
Regular soda bottles = 5 + (50% of 5)
= 5 + (0.50 * 5)
= 5 + 2.5
= 7.5
Since we can't have half a bottle, we'll round to the nearest whole number. Assuming we round up, the first brand has 8 regular soda bottles.

2. For the second brand:
Diet soda bottles = 6
Regular soda bottles = 6 + (80% of 6)
= 6 + (0.80 * 6)
= 6 + 4.8
= 10.8
Rounding to the nearest whole number, the second brand has 11 regular soda bottles.

3. For the third brand:
Diet soda bottles = 9
Regular soda bottles = 9 + (40% of 9)
= 9 + (0.40 * 9)
= 9 + 3.6
= 12.6
Rounding to the nearest whole number, the third brand has 13 regular soda bottles.

4. For the fourth brand:
Diet soda bottles = 10
Regular soda bottles = 10 + (100% of 10)
= 10 + (1.00 * 10)
= 10 + 10
= 20
The fourth brand has 20 regular soda bottles.

Now, let's add up the total number of regular soda bottles for each brand:
First brand = 8 bottles
Second brand = 11 bottles
Third brand = 13 bottles
Fourth brand = 20 bottles

Total regular soda bottles = 8 + 11 + 13 + 20 = 52 bottles.","Let's solve this problem step by step. 

There are four brands, and each has a different number of diet soda bottles: 5, 6, 9, and 10. 

To find the regular soda bottles, we'll increase the diet bottles by the given percentages:
1. For the first brand, 50% more is 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 extra bottles. So, there are 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 regular bottles.
2. The second brand has 80% more, which is 6 * 0.8 = 4.8 extra bottles. This gives a total of 6 + 4.8 = 10.8 regular bottles.
3. The third brand has a 40% increase, which is 9 * 0.4 = 3.6 extra bottles. So, the regular bottles here total 9 + 3.6 = 12.6.
4. Finally, the fourth brand has 100% more, which doubles the diet bottles to 20 regular soda bottles. 

Adding up the regular soda bottles for each brand gives us 7.5 + 10.8 + 12.6 + 20 = 40.9.

Therefore, the total number of regular soda bottles is 41.

Forty-one.","Let's calculate the total number of regular soda bottles for each brand:

1. For the first brand, the diet soda section has 5 bottles. To find the number of regular soda bottles, we multiply the diet soda bottles by 1.5 (50% more):
   5 bottles * 1.5 = 7.5 bottles
   Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 8 bottles.

2. For the second brand, the diet soda section has 6 bottles. To find the number of regular soda bottles, we multiply the diet soda bottles by 1.8 (80% more):
   6 bottles * 1.8 = 10.8 bottles
   Again, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 11 bottles.

3. For the third brand, the diet soda section has 9 bottles. To find the number of regular soda bottles, we multiply the diet soda bottles by 1.4 (40% more):
   9 bottles * 1.4 = 12.6 bottles
   We'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 13 bottles.

4. For the fourth brand, the diet soda section has 10 bottles. To find the number of regular soda bottles, we multiply the diet soda bottles by 2 (100% more):
   10 bottles * 2 = 20 bottles.

So, the total number of regular soda bottles for each brand is:
- First brand: 8 bottles
- Second brand: 11 bottles
- Third brand: 13 bottles
- Fourth brand: 20 bottles

Katie has 91 games.
Each new friend has 88 games, and there are 5 new friends, so they have a total of 5 * 88 games.

Total games for new friends = 5 * 88 = 440 games.

Now, let's calculate the total number of games owned by her old friends:

Each old friend has 53 games, and there are 3 old friends, so they have a total of 3 * 53 games.

Total games for old friends = 3 * 53 = 159 games.

Now, let's add up all the games:

Total games for Katie, new friends, and old friends = Katie's games + New friends' games + Old friends' games
Total games = 91 + 440 + 159
Total games = 690

Now, if each game costs $20, we can find the total cost of all the games by multiplying the total number of games by the cost per game:

Total cost = Total games * Cost per game
Total cost = 690 * $20
Total cost = $13,800

So, the total cost of games owned by Katie and all her friends is $13,800.","Katie has 91 games which cost 91 * $20 = $1820.

Now, let's add up all the games:
Katie's games + new friends' games + old friends' games = 91 + 440 + 159 = 710 DS games.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of these games. Each game costs $20, so:

Paco had 9 sweet cookies and ate 36 sweet cookies. Since he can't eat more cookies than he has, it seems there might be a mistake in the information provided. However, if we proceed with the given information, Paco would have a negative number of sweet cookies, which is not possible. So, let's assume Paco had at least 36 sweet cookies to begin with, and after eating, he would have 0 sweet cookies left.

Total expenses = $9 + $20 + $15 + $8 = $52

Edward has $17 left after all the expenses. To find out how much money he had initially, we add the total expenses to the amount he has left:

After that, he spent $15 on a meal, so \( X - 9 - 20 \) is the amount of money he had left.

Next, he spent $10 on a movie ticket with a $2 student discount. The discount amount is \( 0.02 \times 10 \), which is $0.20. So, the amount he paid for the movie ticket is \( 10 - 0.20 \), which is $9.80.

Finally, he has $17 left, so \( X - 9 - 20 - 15 - 9.80 = 17 \).

Now, let's solve for \( X \):

\( X - 9 - 20 - 15 - 9.80 = 17 \)
\( X - 54.80 = 17 \)
\( X = 17 + 54.80 \)
\( X = 71.80 \)

So, Edward had $71.80 initially before spending on these items.",Fifty-one,71.80,Sixty-nine
885,"The grasshopper, the frog, the mouse, and the kangaroo had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. The kangaroo jumped twice as far as the mouse and the grasshopper combined. How far did each animal jump?","Let's start by figuring out how far the frog jumped. Since the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, we can write the following equation for the frog's jump:

Grasshopper's jump = Frog's jump + 4 inches

We know the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, so:

19 inches = Frog's jump + 4 inches

Now, we can solve for the frog's jump:

Frog's jump = 19 inches - 4 inches
Frog's jump = 15 inches

Next, let's find out how far the mouse jumped. The mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog, so:

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 44 inches

We already know the frog jumped 15 inches, so:

Mouse's jump = 15 inches - 44 inches

Since we can't have a negative jump distance, it seems there might be a mistake in the information provided. Could you please check the details again?","Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
2. The frog jumped 15 inches (4 inches lesser than the grasshopper).
3. The mouse jumped 11 inches (44 inches lesser than the frog).
4. The kangaroo jumped 41 inches (twice the sum of the grasshopper's and mouse's jumps).

So, the final jumps of the animals are: 

Frog: 15 inches
Mouse: 11 inches
Grasshopper: 19 inches
Kangaroo: 41 inches

The final result is 15, 11, 19, 41.

**41**","Let's denote the frog's jump as F inches.

According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump is F + 4 inches.

The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse's jump is F - 44 inches.

The kangaroo jumped twice as far as the mouse and the grasshopper combined, so the kangaroo's jump is 2 * (F + 4 + F - 44) inches.

Now, let's find the frog's jump:

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches, and the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so the frog's jump is 19 - 4 inches.

Now we have:

F + 4 = 19
F = 19 - 4
F = 15 inches

Now we can find the jumps for the other animals:

The grasshopper's jump is F + 4, so it is 15 + 4 inches = 19 inches.

The mouse's jump is F - 44, so it is 15 - 44 inches = -29 inches (which is not possible, so there must be a mistake in the information given).

The kangaroo's jump is 2 * (F + 4 + F - 44), so it is 2 * (15 + 4 + 15 - 44) inches = 2 * (34 - 40) inches = 2 * (-6) inches = -12 inches (which is not possible, so there must be a mistake in the information given).

It seems there is a mistake in the information given about the mouse and the kangaroo's jumps. Please check the information again and provide the correct details.",41,15,15 inches

How many more cups of sugar than cups of cocoa powder does she need to add now?","Mary needs to add the following amounts to meet the recipe requirements:

Sugar: 7 cups - 3 cups already added = 4 cups needed
Flour: She has already added more than required (12 cups instead of 9 cups), so no more flour is needed.
Salt: 5 cups - 4.5 cups already added = 0.5 cups needed
Cocoa powder: 4 cups needed (since none has been added yet)
Milk: 2 cups - 1 cup already added = 1 cup needed

Now, to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of cocoa powder she needs to add:

Sugar needed: 4 cups
Cocoa powder needed: 4 cups

The difference between the sugar needed and the cocoa powder needed is:

4 cups (sugar) - 4 cups (cocoa powder) = 0 cups

Mary needs to add the same amount of sugar as cocoa powder, so there is no difference in the amount she needs to add now.","Mary's recipe calls for more sugar (7 cups) than cocoa powder (4 cups). She needs to add 3 cups of sugar, as she is short this amount after having added 3 cups already. For cocoa powder, she needs to add 3.5 cups, as she has only added 0.5 cups.

Alyssa, on the other hand, did twice as many push-ups, half as many crunches, and 8 less pull-ups than Zachary. How many push-ups, crunches, and pull-ups did each of Alyssa, David, and Zachary do?","Let's start by calculating the number of push-ups, crunches, and pull-ups Zachary did:

Zachary:
- Push-ups: 44
- Crunches: 17
- Pull-ups: 23

Now let's calculate David's numbers based on Zachary's:

David:
- Push-ups: Zachary's push-ups + 29 = 44 + 29 = 73
- Crunches: Zachary's crunches - 13 = 17 - 13 = 4
- Pull-ups: Zachary's pull-ups + 10 = 23 + 10 = 33

Finally, let's calculate Alyssa's numbers based on Zachary's:

Alyssa:
- Push-ups: Zachary's push-ups * 2 = 44 * 2 = 88
- Crunches: Zachary's crunches / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5 (since we can't do half a crunch, let's assume Alyssa did 8 or 9 crunches)
- Pull-ups: Zachary's pull-ups - 8 = 23 - 8 = 15

So, the final counts for each person are:

Zachary:
- Push-ups: 44

- Pull-ups: 23

David:
- Push-ups: 73
- Crunches: 4

- Zachary: 44 push-ups, 17 crunches, 23 pull-ups
- David: 29 more push-ups and 10 more pull-ups than Zachary, and 13 less crunches than Zachary
- Alyssa: Twice as many push-ups as Zachary, half as many crunches as Zachary, and 8 fewer pull-ups than Zachary

Step 1: Let's start with Zachary's numbers: 44 push-ups, 17 crunches, and 23 pull-ups.

Step 2: David's results can be found by adding 29 push-ups and 10 pull-ups, and subtracting 13 crunches from Zachary's counts. This gives David 56 push-ups, 4 crunches, and 31 pull-ups.

Step 3: Alyssa does twice as many push-ups as Zachary, so 2 x 44 = 88 push-ups. She does half as many crunches, so 17 / 2 = 8.5 crunches, rounded down to 8. And she does 8 fewer pull-ups than Zachary, so 23 - 8 = 15 pull-ups.

Step 4: Alyssa's final counts are 88 push-ups, 8 crunches, and 15 pull-ups.

David did 10 more pull-ups than Zachary, so he did 23 + 10 = 33 pull-ups.

David did 13 less crunches than Zachary, so he did 17 - 13 = 4 crunches.

Alyssa did twice as many push-ups as Zachary, so she did 44 * 2 = 88 push-ups.

Alyssa did half as many crunches as Zachary, so she did 17 / 2 = 8.5 crunches (since you can't do half a crunch, we'll round up to 9 crunches).

He also has 28 aquariums for saltwater animals, where 18 aquariums have 52 animals each, and the other 10 aquariums have another number of animals. If Tyler has a total of 6,310 freshwater animals, how many saltwater animals does he have, assuming each saltwater aquarium has at least 20 animals?","First, let's calculate the total number of freshwater animals in the 38 aquariums that have 64 animals each:

38 aquariums * 64 animals/aquarium = 2432 animals

Now, we know Tyler has a total of 6,310 freshwater animals. Let's subtract the number of animals in the 38 aquariums from this total to find out how many animals are in the remaining 14 aquariums:

6,310 total freshwater animals - 2,432 animals in 38 aquariums = 3,878 animals in 14 aquariums

Now, let's calculate the total number of saltwater animals in the 18 aquariums that have 52 animals each:

18 aquariums * 52 animals/aquarium = 936 animals

We are told that each of the remaining 10 saltwater aquariums has at least 20 animals. Let's calculate the minimum number of animals these 10 aquariums could have:

10 aquariums * 20 animals/aquarium = 200 animals

Now, let's add the number of animals in the 18 aquariums to the minimum number of animals in the 10 aquariums to find out the minimum total number of saltwater animals Tyler could have:

936 animals in 18 aquariums + 200 animals in 10 aquariums = 1136 animals

Therefore, Tyler has at least 1,136 saltwater animals.","Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that 38 aquariums have 64 animals each, and the remaining 14 aquariums have a different number of animals. To find the total number of saltwater animals:

38 aquariums with 64 animals each = 2,432 animals

14 aquariums with an unknown number of animals will be represented as x

2,432 + x = 6,310

Now, we subtract this from the total number of animals to find the number of saltwater animals:

6,310 - 2,432 - x = Saltwater Animals

x must be 3,878.

Therefore, the number of saltwater animals is 3,878. 

The final result: 3878.","First, let's find out how many animals are in the remaining 14 freshwater aquariums. Since we know that 38 aquariums have 64 animals each, we can calculate the total number of animals in those aquariums:

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of freshwater animals to find out how many animals are in the remaining 14 aquariums:

6,310 total freshwater animals - 2,432 animals in 38 aquariums = 3,878 animals in 14 aquariums

Now, we need to find out how many animals are in each of the remaining 14 freshwater aquariums. Since we don't have the exact number of animals in each aquarium, we'll assume that each aquarium has the same number of animals. To find out that number, we divide the total number of animals in the remaining 14 aquariums by the number of aquariums:

3,878 animals / 14 aquariums = 276.2857... animals/aquarium

Since we can't have a fraction of an animal, we'll round this number to the nearest whole number. Since 276 is closer to 277 than 276, we'll round up to 277 animals/aquarium.

Now, let's find out how many saltwater animals Tyler has. We know that 18 saltwater aquariums have 52 animals each, so we can calculate the total number of animals in those aquariums:

18 aquariums * 52 animals/aquarium = 936 animals

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of saltwater animals to find out how many animals are in the remaining 10 aquariums:

2,800 total saltwater animals - 936 animals in 18 aquariums = 1,864 animals in 10 aquariums

Now, we need to find out how many animals are in each of the remaining 10 saltwater aquariums. Since we don't have the exact number of animals in each aquarium, we'll assume that each aquarium has the same number of animals.

How many flowers of each type are there in the vase now, and what is the total number of flowers in the vase?","Let's calculate the number of each type of flower in the vase now:

Roses: Initially, there were 9 roses, and now there are 12. So, Jessica added 12 - 9 = 3 more roses.

Orchids: Initially, there were 6 orchids, and now there are 16. So, Jessica added 16 - 6 = 10 more orchids.

Lilies: There were no lilies initially, and now there are 5. So, Jessica added 5 lilies.

Tulips: There are twice as many tulips as there are lilies, so there are 5 lilies * 2 = 10 tulips.

Now, let's calculate the total number of flowers in the vase:

Roses: 12
Orchids: 16
Lilies: 5
Tulips: 10

Total number of flowers = 12 roses + 16 orchids + 5 lilies + 10 tulips

Apples sold: 15% of 36 = 0.15 * 36 = 5.4
Since we can't sell a fraction of an apple, we'll round down to 5 apples sold.

Oranges sold: 15% of 45 = 0.15 * 45 = 6.75
Since we can't sell a fraction of an orange, we'll round down to 6 oranges sold.

891,"Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?","Let's denote the number of minutes Milan used the second phone line as \( x \). Since he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second, the number of minutes he used the first phone line is \( x + 20 \).

The total cost for the first phone line is the monthly fee plus the cost per minute times the number of minutes, which is \( 3 + 0.15(x + 20) \).

The total cost for the second phone line is the monthly fee plus the cost per minute times the number of minutes, which is \( 4 + 0.10x \).

The total cost for both lines is the sum of the costs for each line, which is \( 56 \) dollars.

So, we have the equation:

\( 3 + 0.15(x + 20) + 4 + 0.10x = 56 \)

Combining like terms and simplifying, we get:

\( 0.15x + 3 + 0.10x + 4 = 56 - 20 \)

\( 0.25x + 7 = 36 \)

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get:

\( 0.25x = 29 \)

Dividing both sides by 0.25, we get:

\( x = 29 / 0.25 \)

\( x = 116 \)

So, Milan used the second phone line for 116 minutes and the first phone line for \( 116 + 20 = 136 \) minutes.

The total number of minutes Milan was billed for on both lines is \( 116 + 136 = 252 \) minutes.","Milan's long-distance bill was 56 dollars, and the monthly fees for both lines are 3 + 4 = 7 dollars. Assuming the bills for the minutes used are added together, the cost of the minutes is therefore 56 - 7 = 49 dollars.
The first line contributed 3 x 15 = 45 cents more than the second line to the total minute costs.
This means that the second line's minutes cost 49 - 45 = 4 dollars.
As 10 cents represent one minute, Milan was billed for a total of 4 / 0.10 = 40 minutes on the second line.
If the first line used 20 more minutes than the second, it used 20 + 40 = 60 minutes.
The total minutes billed on both lines are 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.

100 minutes.","Let's denote the number of minutes Milan used on the first phone line as M1 and the number of minutes on the second phone line as M2. We know that M1 = M2 + 20.

The cost for the first phone line is the monthly fee plus the per-minute cost:
Cost for first line = Monthly fee + (Per minute cost * Minutes used)
Cost for first line = $3 + (0.15 * M1)

The cost for the second phone line is the monthly fee plus the per-minute cost:
Cost for second line = Monthly fee + (Per minute cost * Minutes used)
Cost for second line = $4 + (0.10 * M2)

The total cost for both lines is the sum of the costs for each line:
Total cost = Cost for first line + Cost for second line
Total cost = ($3 + (0.15 * M1)) + ($4 + (0.10 * M2))

We know that the total cost for both lines last month was $56.00, so we can set up the equation:
($3 + (0.15 * M1)) + ($4 + (0.10 * M2)) = $56.00

Now, let's substitute M1 with M2 + 20:
($3 + (0.15 * (M2 + 20))) + ($4 + (0.10 * M2)) = $56.00

Let's distribute the multiplication terms:
($3 + 0.15M2 + 3.00) + ($4 + 0.10M2) = $56.00

Now, let's combine like terms:
($3 + 0.15M2 + 3.00) + ($4 + 0.10M2) = $56.00
($3 + 3.00) + ($4 + 0.10M2) + (0.15M2 + 3.00) = $56.00
($6 + 0.10M2) + (0.15M2 + 3.00) = $56.00

Now, let's solve for M2:
($6 + 0.10M2) + (0.15M2 + 3.00) = $56.00

1. y = 1.5x (since y is 1.5 times greater than x)
2. 0.5x - 10 = 0.25y (since 0.5 of x minus 10 is equal to 0.25 of y)

Now we can substitute the expression for y from equation 1 into equation 2:

0.5x - 10 = 0.25(1.5x)

Now let's solve for x:

0.5x - 10 = 0.375x (because 0.25 * 1.5 = 0.375)
10 = 0.375x - 0.5x (move 0.5x to the right side)
10 = -0.125x (combine like terms)
x = 10 / -0.125 (divide both sides by -0.125 to solve for x)
x = -80

So the number x we are looking for is -80. Now let's find y:

y = 1.5 * -80
y = -120

Therefore, the two numbers are x = -80 and y = -120.","We are asked to find x in terms of y, where y is 1.5 times greater than x. We also have the equation 0.5x - 10 = 0.25y. 

We can solve this by first dividing both sides of the equation by 0.25 to get 2x - 40 = y. Next, we subtract y from both sides: -0.5x + 39.75 = 0. 

So, 0.5x = 39.75, or x = **79.5**. 

The final result is 79.5.","Let's denote the number we want to find as x. According to the problem, y is 1.5 times greater than x, so we can write:

y = 1.5x

We are given that 0.5 of x minus 10 is equal to 0.25 of y:

0.5x - 10 = 0.25y

Substituting the expression for y into the equation, we get:

0.5x - 10 = 0.25(1.5x)

Now, let's solve for x:

0.5x - 10 = 0.75x
0.5x = 0.75x + 10
0.25x = 10
x = 40

So, the number we want to find is 40.",79.5,40,-120
893,"Trenton sells three types of electronic supplies with varying commissions: Type A, Type B, and Type C. Each week he earns a base salary of 190 dollars, plus different commissions on each type of product:

- 4 % commission on Type A sales
- 6 % commission on Type B sales
- 8 % commission on Type C sales

This week, his goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. Additionally, Trenton is limited by a weekly sales cap imposed by his employer that does not allow him to sell more than 8,000 dollars worth of products combined. Write and solve a system of inequalities to find the possible combinations of sales for Type A, Type B, and Type C products that would allow Trenton to reach his income goal without exceeding the weekly sales cap.","Let's denote the sales of Type A, Type B, and Type C products as \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively. We have the following system of inequalities based on the given information:

1. The total sales should not exceed 8,000 dollars:
\[ A + B + C \leq 8000 \]

2. Trenton's total earnings should be at least 500 dollars. His earnings are composed of his base salary plus the commissions from the three types of sales:
\[ 190 + 0.04A + 0.06B + 0.08C \geq 500 \]

Now, let's solve the system of inequalities.

First, we simplify the second inequality to find the minimum sales needed to reach the 500 dollars goal:

\[ 0.04A + 0.06B + 0.08C \geq 500 - 190 \]
\[ 0.04A + 0.06B + 0.08C \geq 310 \]

Now, we can express this inequality in terms of one of the variables, say \( C \), to find the range of sales for Type C products that would allow Trenton to reach his income goal:

\[ 0.08C \geq 310 - 0.04A - 0.06B \]
\[ C \geq \frac{310 - 0.04A - 0.06B}{0.08} \]

Since \( C \) must be non-negative, we also have:
\[ C \geq 0 \]

Similarly, we have for \( A \) and \( B \):
\[ A \geq 0 \]
\[ B \geq 0 \]

Now we have a system of inequalities:

\[ A + B + C \leq 8000 \]
\[ C \geq \frac{310 - 0.04A - 0.06B}{0.08} \]
\[ A \geq 0 \]
\[ B \geq 0 \]
\[ C \geq 0 \]

To find the possible combinations of sales, we would need to consider all values of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) that satisfy all of the above inequalities. This would typically be done graphically by plotting the inequalities on a three-dimensional coordinate system and finding the region where all inequalities overlap. However, this can be quite complex to visualize and solve manually, so computational tools or optimization techniques are often used to find solutions to such systems.","**Step 1**: First, we need to identify the constraints. Trenton's income goal is $500, and the weekly sales cap is $8000. We also know the commission rates for each product type. 

We can represent Type A sales as x, Type B sales as y, and Type C sales as z. The system of inequalities is as follows: 

- 0.04x + 0.06y + 0.08z ≥ 500 (income goal)
- x + y + z ≤ 8000 (weekly sales cap)
- x, y, z ≥ 0 (no negative sales)

**Step 2**: We can't solve this with one method alone, so we'll use graphing and linear algebra to solve this system.
First, we'll graph the plane corresponding to the weekly sales cap and the half-planes representing the income goal and the three types of sales. The feasible region will be the area below the plane and above the half-planes.

**Step 3**: The feasible region seems to be a trapezoid. We can now determine the solutions by checking the coordinates of the vertices of the feasible region. 

The solutions are: 
900 dollars for Type A, 1800 dollars for Type B, and 2100 dollars for Type C.

**Answer**: 2100.","Let's denote the sales of Type A, Type B, and Type C products as A, B, and C respectively.

The total income Trenton earns is the sum of his base salary and the commissions from each type of product:

Total Income = Base Salary + Commission on Type A + Commission on Type B + Commission on Type C
Total Income = 190 + 0.04A + 0.06B + 0.08C

The total sales of all products combined cannot exceed the weekly sales cap:

Total Sales = A + B + C ≤ 8,000

Trenton's goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars, so we need to find the possible combinations of sales for each type of product that would allow him to reach this income goal without exceeding the weekly sales cap.

First, let's find the minimum amount of commission Trenton can earn from each type of product to reach his income goal:

Minimum Commission on Type A = 0.04A = 500 / 100 = 5
Minimum Commission on Type B = 0.06B = 500 / 100 = 5
Minimum Commission on Type C = 0.08C = 500 / 100 = 5

Now, let's write the system of inequalities based on the minimum commissions and the weekly sales cap:

1) Total Income ≥ 500
2) Total Income = 190 + 5 + 5 + 5
3) Total Income = 190 + 15
4) Total Income = 205
5) 205 = 190 + 15
6) 15 = 5 + 5 + 5
7) 15 = 15
8) A + B + C ≤ 8,000

Since the minimum commission for each type of product is 5, we can express the total income as:

Total Income = 190 + 5A + 5B + 5C

Now, let's substitute the minimum commission for each type of product into the total income inequality:

1) 190 + 5A + 5B + 5C ≥ 500

Now, let's solve for A, B, and C:

1) 190 + 5A + 5B + 5C = 500
2) 5A + 5B + 5C = 500 - 190
3) 5A + 5B + 5C = 310
4) A + B + C = 31",2100,31,complex
894,"The maximum load that a horizontal beam can carry is directly proportional to its width and inversely proportional to its length. Additionally, the type of material used for the beam is an important factor that contributes to its load capacity. Given that a 10-foot long beam made from Material A with a width of 1.5 inches can support a load of 250 pounds, determine the load capacity of a 12-foot long beam made from Material B with a width of 3.5 inches, if Material B can withstand 1.25 times the stress of Material A.","Let's denote the maximum load a beam can carry as \( L \), the width of the beam as \( W \), the length of the beam as \( L_b \), and a proportionality constant as \( k \) which will also account for the material's ability to withstand stress. The relationship between the load, width, and length can be expressed as:

\[ L = k \cdot \frac{W}{L_b} \]

Given that a 10-foot long beam made from Material A with a width of 1.5 inches can support a load of 250 pounds, we can write:

\[ 250 = k_A \cdot \frac{1.5}{10} \]

Now, we need to find the value of \( k_A \) for Material A:

\[ k_A = \frac{250 \cdot 10}{1.5} \]
\[ k_A = \frac{2500}{1.5} \]
\[ k_A = \frac{5000}{3} \]
\[ k_A = \frac{1666.67}{1} \]

Now, we know that Material B can withstand 1.25 times the stress of Material A, so the proportionality constant for Material B, \( k_B \), will be:

\[ k_B = 1.25 \cdot k_A \]
\[ k_B = 1.25 \cdot 1666.67 \]
\[ k_B = 2083.34 \]

Now we can find the load capacity of a 12-foot long beam made from Material B with a width of 3.5 inches:

\[ L_B = k_B \cdot \frac{W_B}{L_{bB}} \]
\[ L_B = 2083.34 \cdot \frac{3.5}{12} \]
\[ L_B = 2083.34 \cdot \frac{7}{24} \]
\[ L_B = 2083.34 \cdot \frac{7}{24} \]
\[ L_B = 2083.34 \cdot 0.29167 \]
\[ L_B = 608.34 \]

Therefore, the load capacity of a 12-foot long beam made from Material B with a width of 3.5 inches is approximately 608.34 pounds.","To solve this problem, we need to determine the load capacity of the 12-foot long beam made from Material B.

We can set up a proportion based on the given information:
The ratio of the maximum load supported by the 10-foot beam made from Material A to the 12-foot beam should be 10/12 because the length is directly proportional to the load capacity. 

Material A's width is 1.5 inches, and Material B's width is 3.5 inches. The ratio of the width of Material B to Material A is thus 3.5/1.5. 

Material B can withstand 1.25 times the stress of Material A, so the load capacity of Material B is 1.25 times that of Material A.

Putting it all together, we get:
1.25 * (load capacity of 12-foot Material A beam) = Load capacity of 12-foot Material B beam.

1.25 * (250 pounds) = 312.5 pounds

The 12-foot long beam made from Material B, with a width of 3.5 inches, can support a load of **312.5 pounds**.","Let's denote the load capacity of the 10-foot long beam made from Material A as \( L_A \). According to the given information, \( L_A = 250 \text{ pounds} \).

The load capacity of a beam is directly proportional to its width and inversely proportional to its length. This can be expressed as:

\[ L = k \times \text{width} \times \frac{1}{\text{length}} \]

where \( k \) is a constant that depends on the material and other factors.

For the 10-foot long beam made from Material A, we have:

\[ 250 = k \times 1.5 \times \frac{1}{10} \]

To find the value of \( k \), we can solve for \( k \):

\[ k = \frac{250}{1.5 \times \frac{1}{10}} \]

\[ k = \frac{250}{1.5 \times 0.1} \]

\[ k = \frac{250}{1.5} \times \frac{10}{1} \]

895,"The value of a sport utility vehicle this year is 16,000 dollars. The vehicle experiences a variable annual depreciation rate. In the first year, the depreciation rate was 15%, and it increases by 2% each year thereafter. If this year is the n-th year of owning the vehicle, determine the value of the vehicle at the time of purchase.","Let's denote the initial purchase price of the vehicle as P. We are given that the value of the vehicle in the n-th year is $16,000, and the depreciation rate in the first year is 15%, increasing by 2% each subsequent year.

The depreciation rate in the n-th year would then be 15% + (n - 1) * 2%. We can express this as a decimal by dividing by 100, so the depreciation rate in the n-th year is 0.15 + (n - 1) * 0.02.

The value of the vehicle after n years, V(n), can be found by multiplying the initial purchase price by the product of (1 - the depreciation rate) for each year. So, we have:

V(n) = P * (1 - 0.15) * (1 - (0.15 + 0.02)) * (1 - (0.15 + 2*0.02)) * ... * (1 - (0.15 + (n - 1)*0.02))

We know that V(n) = $16,000. We need to solve for P.

Let's denote each year's depreciation factor as D(i) where i is the year number. So for the first year, D(1) = (1 - 0.15), for the second year, D(2) = (1 - (0.15 + 0.02)), and so on until the n-th year, D(n) = (1 - (0.15 + (n - 1)*0.02)).

The product of all depreciation factors from year 1 to year n is:

D = D(1) * D(2) * ... * D(n)

So we can rewrite the equation for V(n) as:

V(n) = P * D

To find P, we need to divide both sides by D:

P = V(n) / D

Since we don't know the exact value of n, we can't calculate the exact value of D and, consequently, the exact value of P. However, we can express P in terms of D:

P = $16,000 / D

To find the exact value of P, we would need the specific value of n, which would allow us to calculate D. If you can provide the value of n, we can proceed with the calculation. Otherwise, this is the general formula for the initial purchase price based on the given information.","We have the initial value of the SUV as $16000, and we know the depreciation rate starts at 15% and increases by 2% annually. 

Let's use the sequence of numbers to describe the value of the vehicle at the end of each year. 

Starting with $16000, the first year's depreciation would reduce the value to $13,600 (15% reduction). 

In the second year, the reduction is 17% of $13,600, which equals $2,312. So the value at the end of the second year is $11,288. 

For the third year, the depreciation is 19% of $11,288, which is $2,144, leaving the value at $9,144. 

Following this pattern, we can conclude that, in general, the n-th year depreciation is given by Dn = 15% + 2(n - 1)% . 

For the value of the vehicle at the time of purchase, we have:

D1 = $1,600, D2 = $2,312, D3 = $2,144, and so on. Assuming the purchase price was after these depreciations, the value of the vehicle at the time of purchase is the sum of these amounts reversed. 

So, the final answer is **$16,960**.","Let's denote the value of the vehicle at the time of purchase as V.

In the first year, the depreciation rate is 15%, so the value of the vehicle after the first year is:
V - 0.15V = 0.85V

In the second year, the depreciation rate is 15% + 2% = 17%, so the value of the vehicle after the second year is:
0.85V - 0.17V = 0.68V

In the third year, the depreciation rate is 17% + 2% = 19%, so the value of the vehicle after the third year is:
0.68V - 0.19V = 0.49V

This pattern continues for each subsequent year, with the depreciation rate increasing by 2% each year.

Let's denote the value of the vehicle after the n-th year as Vn.

Vn = Vn-1 - (Vn-1 - Vn)
Vn = Vn-1 - (1 - Vn/Vn-1)
Vn = Vn-1 - (1 - (Vn/Vn-1))
Vn = Vn-1 - (1 - (1 - (Vn/Vn-1)))
Vn = Vn-1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - (Vn/Vn-1))))
Vn = Vn-1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - (Vn/Vn-1)))))

This pattern continues, with each term in the series being the previous term minus the current term divided by the previous term.

Since we know the value of the vehicle this year (n-th year) is 16,000 dollars, we can set up the equation:
Vn = 16,000

Now, let's substitute the value of Vn into the equation:
16,000 = Vn-1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - (Vn/Vn-1)))))
16,000 = Vn-1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - (16,000/Vn-1)))))

Now, let's solve for Vn-1:
Vn-1 = 16,000 + (1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - (16,000/Vn-1)))))
Vn-1 = 16,000 + (1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - (16,000/Vn-1)))))
Vn-1 = 16,000 + (1 - (1 -","16,960","16,000",P
896,"Anne and Nancy use a metal alloy that is 29.5 % copper to make jewelry. They want to create a new alloy that consists of 200 ounces in total, with 32 % copper content. If they use a 28 % copper alloy and a third alloy with an unknown percentage of copper, how many ounces of each alloy must be combined to achieve the desired mixture?","Let's denote the amount of the 28% copper alloy as \( x \) ounces and the amount of the third alloy with an unknown percentage of copper as \( y \) ounces. We know that the total amount of the new alloy should be 200 ounces, so we have:

\( x + y = 200 \)  (Equation 1)

We also know that the new alloy should have a 32% copper content. The amount of copper from the 28% alloy will be \( 0.28x \) and the amount of copper from the third alloy will be \( p \cdot y \), where \( p \) is the unknown percentage of copper in the third alloy (expressed as a decimal).

The total amount of copper in the new alloy should be 32% of 200 ounces, which is \( 0.32 \cdot 200 = 64 \) ounces.

So, we have the equation:

\( 0.28x + p \cdot y = 64 \)  (Equation 2)

We have two equations and two unknowns (\( x \) and \( y \)), but we also have an unknown percentage \( p \). To solve for \( x \) and \( y \), we need to express \( p \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \).

Since we don't have the value of \( p \), we can't solve for the exact amounts of \( x \) and \( y \). However, we can express the amount of the third alloy needed in terms of \( p \).

From Equation 1, we can express \( y \) as:

\( y = 200 - x \)

Substituting \( y \) in Equation 2, we get:

\( 0.28x + p \cdot (200 - x) = 64 \)

Expanding the equation, we get:

\( 0.28x + 200p - px = 64 \)

Rearranging the terms, we get:

\( (0.28 - p)x = 64 - 200p \)

Now, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( p \):

\( x = \frac{64 - 200p}{0.28 - p} \)

And since \( y = 200 - x \), we can also express \( y \) in terms of \( p \):

\( y = 200 - \frac{64 - 200p}{0.28 - p} \)

Without the value of \( p \), we cannot determine the exact amounts of \( x \) and \( y \). If you have the percentage of copper in the third alloy, we can plug it into the equations to find the exact amounts.","To create 200 ounces of a 32% copper alloy, we need to mix the given 29.5% and 28% copper alloys prudently.

We start by calculating the difference in copper content that needs to be made up in the final alloy: 32% - 29.5% = 2.5%. 

This means that for every 100 ounces of alloy, we need to add 2.5% copper. Converting this to a whole alloy of 200 ounces, we find the extra alloy needed is 2.5% x 200 oz = 5 oz. 

Now, we know that the 28% copper alloy provides this extra 5 oz for every 100 oz mixed in. So, to get to the final desired quantity of 200 oz, we need only mix in 5 oz / 5 oz/100 oz * 200 oz = 10 oz of the 28% copper alloy with the 29.5% copper alloy.

**10 ounces**","First, let's calculate the amount of copper in the desired alloy. Since the desired alloy is 32% copper, we can find the amount of copper by multiplying the total weight of the alloy by the percentage of copper:

Amount of copper = Total weight of alloy × Percentage of copper
Amount of copper = 200 ounces × 0.32
Amount of copper = 64 ounces

Now, let's calculate the amount of copper in the 28% copper alloy:

Amount of copper in 28% alloy = Total weight of alloy × Percentage of copper
Amount of copper in 28% alloy = 200 ounces × 0.28
Amount of copper in 28% alloy = 56 ounces

Since we know the total amount of copper in the desired alloy, we can find the amount of copper in the third alloy by subtracting the amount of copper in the 28% alloy from the total amount of copper:

Amount of copper in third alloy = Total amount of copper - Amount of copper in 28% alloy
Amount of copper in third alloy = 64 ounces - 56 ounces
Amount of copper in third alloy = 8 ounces

Now, let's find the percentage of copper in the third alloy:

Percentage of copper in third alloy = Amount of copper in third alloy / Total weight of alloy
Percentage of copper in third alloy = 8 ounces / 200 ounces
Percentage of copper in third alloy = 0.04

Since we know the percentage of copper in the third alloy, we can find the weight of the third alloy by multiplying the total weight of the alloy by the percentage of copper:

Weight of third alloy = Total weight of alloy × Percentage of copper in third alloy
Weight of third alloy = 200 ounces × 0.04
Weight of third alloy = 8 ounces

Now, let's find the weight of the 28% copper alloy:

Weight of 28% alloy = Total weight of alloy × Percentage of copper in 28% alloy
Weight of 28% alloy = 200 ounces × 0.28
Weight of 28% alloy = 56 ounces

Finally, let's find the weight of the 29.5% copper alloy:

Weight of 29.5% alloy = Total weight of alloy × Percentage of copper in 29.5% alloy
Weight of 29.5% alloy = 200 ounces × 0.295
Weight of 29.5% alloy = 59 ounces

In summary, to achieve the desired mixture, Anne and Nancy must combine:
- 56 ounces of the 28% copper alloy",10,56 ounces,x and y.

There were a total of 2,500 tickets sold, with a total revenue of 23,580 dollars. The number of senior citizen tickets sold was twice the number of children tickets sold. How many student tickets were sold?","Let's denote the number of student tickets as S, non-student tickets as N, senior citizen tickets as Sr, and children tickets as C. We are given the following information:

1. The price of tickets:
- Student tickets: $9
- Non-student tickets: $11
- Senior citizen tickets: $7
- Children tickets: $5

2. The total number of tickets sold: 2,500
3. The total revenue: $23,580
4. The number of senior citizen tickets sold was twice the number of children tickets sold: Sr = 2C

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

Equation 1 (total tickets sold): S + N + Sr + C = 2,500
Equation 2 (total revenue): 9S + 11N + 7Sr + 5C = 23,580
Equation 3 (relation between senior citizen and children tickets): Sr = 2C

We can use Equation 3 to substitute Sr in Equations 1 and 2:

Equation 1 becomes: S + N + 2C + C = 2,500
Simplifying, we get: S + N + 3C = 2,500

Equation 2 becomes: 9S + 11N + 7(2C) + 5C = 23,580
Simplifying, we get: 9S + 11N + 14C + 5C = 23,580
Further simplifying, we get: 9S + 11N + 19C = 23,580

Now we have two equations with three unknowns:
S + N + 3C = 2,500 (Equation 4)
9S + 11N + 19C = 23,580 (Equation 5)

We need one more equation to solve for the three unknowns. However, we are not given any additional information to create a third equation. Therefore, we cannot solve for the exact number of student tickets sold with the information provided. We would need additional information, such as the exact number of tickets sold in one of the categories or another relationship between the categories.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. We have the following equations from the question: 
$9x + 11y + 7z + 5t = 23,580
x + y + 2z + t = 2,500$

2. We can solve for each variable by simplifying the equations:
$9x + 11y = 14,010$
$x + y = 1,500$

3. We can solve this simultaneously or sequentially. Let's solve for x and y separately:
$x = 1,500 - y$
9x = 14,010 - 9y

4. We can solve this linear equation to yield:
$y = 300$
$x = 1,200$

5. Therefore, the number of student tickets sold is 1,200.

The final result: 1200.","Let's denote the number of student tickets sold as S, the number of non-student tickets sold as N, the number of senior citizen tickets sold as SC, and the number of children tickets sold as C.

According to the problem, SC = 2C.

We are given the total number of tickets sold (2,500) and the total revenue (23,580 dollars). We can use these to find the average ticket price.

The average ticket price is the total revenue divided by the total number of tickets sold:
Average ticket price = Total revenue / Total number of tickets sold
Average ticket price = 23,580 dollars / 2,500 tickets
Average ticket price = 9.432 dollars per ticket

Now, we can find the number of each type of ticket sold by dividing the total revenue by the price of each type of ticket.

Number of student tickets sold = Total revenue / Price per student ticket
Number of student tickets sold = 23,580 dollars / 9 dollars per ticket
Number of student tickets sold = 2,620 tickets

Since the number of senior citizen tickets sold is twice the number of children tickets sold, we can find the number of children tickets sold by dividing the number of senior citizen tickets sold by 2.

Number of children tickets sold = Number of senior citizen tickets sold / 2
Number of children tickets sold = 2,620 tickets / 2
Number of children tickets sold = 1,310 tickets

Now, we can find the number of non-student tickets sold by subtracting the number of student tickets sold, the number of senior citizen tickets sold, and the number of children tickets sold from the total number of tickets sold.

Number of non-student tickets sold = Total number of tickets sold - Number of student tickets sold - Number of senior citizen tickets sold - Number of children tickets sold
Number of non-student tickets sold = 2,500 tickets - 2,620 tickets - 2,620 tickets - 1,310 tickets
Number of non-student tickets sold = 2,500 tickets - 8,550 tickets
Number of non-student tickets sold = 1,350 tickets

Finally, we can find the number of student tickets sold by subtracting the number of non-student tickets sold from the total number of tickets sold.

Number of student tickets sold = Total number of tickets sold - Number of non-student tickets sold
Number of student tickets sold = 2,500 tickets - 1,350 tickets
Number of student tickets sold = 1,150 tickets

Therefore, 1,150 student tickets were sold.",1200,"1,150",insufficient information
898,"A semi truck travels on a paved road for 3 hours at an average speed of 20 miles per hour faster than it travels on a dirt road. The time spent on the dirt road is 4 hours. The truck also travels on a gravel road at an average speed that is 10 mph slower than the speed on the dirt road for 2 hours. If the entire trip is 350 miles, how fast is the truck traveling on each type of road?","Let's denote the speed of the truck on the dirt road as \( v \) mph. 

According to the problem, the speed on the paved road is \( v + 20 \) mph, and the speed on the gravel road is \( v - 10 \) mph.

We know the time spent on each type of road:
- Paved road: 3 hours
- Dirt road: 4 hours
- Gravel road: 2 hours

The distance covered on each type of road can be calculated using the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \).

So, the distance covered on the paved road is \( 3(v + 20) \), on the dirt road is \( 4v \), and on the gravel road is \( 2(v - 10) \).

The total distance covered is the sum of the distances on each type of road, which is given as 350 miles. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3(v + 20) + 4v + 2(v - 10) = 350 \]

Now, let's solve for \( v \):

\[ 3v + 60 + 4v + 2v - 20 = 350 \]
\[ 9v + 40 = 350 \]
\[ 9v = 350 - 40 \]
\[ 9v = 310 \]
\[ v = \frac{310}{9} \]
\[ v \approx 34.44 \text{ mph} \]

So, the truck travels on the dirt road at approximately 34.44 mph.

Now, we can find the speeds on the other roads:
- Paved road: \( 34.44 + 20 \approx 54.44 \text{ mph} \)
- Gravel road: \( 34.44 - 10 \approx 24.44 \text{ mph} \)

Therefore, the truck travels at approximately 34.44 mph on the dirt road, 54.44 mph on the paved road, and 24.44 mph on the gravel road.","Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. The truck travels on a paved road at 20 mph faster than on a dirt road. If the dirt road speed is x, then the paved road speed is x + 20. We know the time spent on the paved road is 3 hours, so we can calculate the speed as 3 hours * (x + 20) = distance. 

2. The truck's speed on the dirt road is x mph, and we know this journey lasts 4 hours, so 4 hours * x = distance.

3. Now, the gravel road journey is 10 mph slower than the dirt road. So, the speed here is x - 10 mph, and this trip takes 2 hours: 2 hours * (x - 10) = distance.

4. We also know the total distance traveled is 350 miles for the whole trip. 

So, we have three equations: 

3x + 60 = 350
4x = 200
2x - 20 = 100

Combining these equations, we get x = 40 mph. 

Therefore, the speeds are:
- 60 mph on paved roads
- 40 mph on dirt roads
- 30 mph on gravel roads.

The final result is 60.","Let's denote the average speed on the dirt road as \( V_d \) mph. According to the information given, the semi truck travels on the dirt road for 4 hours, so the distance traveled on the dirt road is \( 4 \times V_d \) miles.

The semi truck travels on the paved road at a speed that is 20 mph faster than on the dirt road, so the speed on the paved road is \( V_d + 20 \) mph. The time spent on the paved road is 3 hours, so the distance traveled on the paved road is \( 3 \times (V_d + 20) \) miles.

The semi truck travels on the gravel road at a speed that is 10 mph slower than on the dirt road, so the speed on the gravel road is \( V_d - 10 \) mph. The time spent on the gravel road is 2 hours, so the distance traveled on the gravel road is \( 2 \times (V_d - 10) \) miles.

The total distance of the trip is 350 miles, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 4 \times V_d + 3 \times (V_d + 20) + 2 \times (V_d - 10) = 350 \]

Now, let's solve for \( V_d \):

\[ 4V_d + 3V_d + 60 + 2V_d - 20 = 350 \]

\[ 9V_d + 60 = 350 \]

\[ 9V_d = 350 - 60 \]

\[ 9V_d = 290 \]

\[ V_d = \frac{290}{9} \]

\[ V_d = 30 \text{ mph} \]

So, the semi truck is traveling on the dirt road at 30 mph.

Now, we can find the speed on the paved road:

\[ V_p = V_d + 20 \]

\[ V_p = 30 + 20 \]

\[ V_p = 50 \text{ mph} \]

And the speed on the gravel road:

\[ V_g = V_d - 10 \]

\[ V_g = 30 - 10 \]

\[ V_g = 20 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the semi truck is traveling on the dirt road at 30 mph, on the paved road at",60,30 mph,34.44
899,"The weight of an object on various celestial bodies varies directly to its weight on Earth. We have the following gravitational force ratios with respect to Earth:

1. Moon: 1/5
2. Mars: 3/8
3. Jupiter: 25/3
4. Venus: 8/9

A person who weighs 133 pounds on Earth weighs 26.6 pounds on the Moon. Calculate how much a 136-pound person would weigh on the Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Venus.","To find the weight of a 136-pound person on the Moon, we can use the ratio of the gravitational force on the Moon to that on Earth, which is 1/5. 

First, we find the weight of a 133-pound person on the Moon:
133 pounds * (1/5) = 26.6 pounds

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the weight of a 136-pound person on the Moon:
133 pounds / 26.6 pounds = 136 pounds / x pounds (where x is the weight on the Moon)

Solving for x:
x = (136 pounds * 26.6 pounds) / 133 pounds
x = 3601.6 / 133
x = 27.08 pounds (approximately)

Now, let's calculate the weight on Mars using the ratio 3/8:
136 pounds * (3/8) = 51 pounds

For Jupiter, using the ratio 25/3:
136 pounds * (25/3) = 1133.33 pounds (approximately)

And for Venus, using the ratio 8/9:
136 pounds * (8/9) = 121.78 pounds (approximately)

So, a 136-pound person would weigh approximately:
- 27.08 pounds on the Moon
- 51 pounds on Mars
- 1133.33 pounds on Jupiter
- 121.78 pounds on Venus","To solve this, we use the given gravitational force ratios. 

For the Moon, the ratio is 1/5, so a person weighing 136 pounds would weigh 136/5 = 27.2 pounds. 

For Mars, the ratio is 3/8, which means a person's weight would be 136 x 3/8 = 51 pounds. 

For Jupiter, the ratio is 25/3, resulting in a weight of 136 x 25/3 = 165.33 pounds. 

On Venus, with a ratio of 8/9, the person would weigh 136 x 8/9 = 57.33 pounds. 

Therefore, a 136-pound person would weigh approximately 27, 51, 165, and 57 pounds on the Moon, Mars, Jupiter, and Venus, respectively.

Venus: 8/9

Now, let's calculate the weight of a 136-pound person on each celestial body:

Moon:
The weight on the Moon is given by the gravitational force ratio for the Moon multiplied by the weight on Earth.
Weight on the Moon = Weight on Earth * Gravitational force ratio for the Moon
Weight on the Moon = 136 pounds * (1/5)
Weight on the Moon = 136 pounds / 5
Weight on the Moon = 27.2 pounds

Mars:
Weight on Mars = Weight on Earth * Gravitational force ratio for Mars
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)
Weight on Mars = 136 pounds * (3/8)

900,"Maria rented a car from a company that charges a daily rate of $35, plus $0.09 per mile driven, and offers a 10% discount for rentals lasting 3 days or more. Additionally, Maria decided to buy an additional insurance coverage plan that costs a flat rate of $5 per day. After renting the car for 4 days and returning it, Maria received a rental invoice of $192.50. How far did she drive during this rental period, in miles?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the rental without considering the miles driven.

Maria rented the car for 4 days, so the daily rate would be $35 per day. The cost for 4 days without the discount and additional insurance would be:
4 days * $35/day = $140

Since Maria rented the car for more than 3 days, she is eligible for a 10% discount. Let's calculate the discount amount:
10% of $140 = 0.10 * $140 = $14

Now, let's subtract the discount from the initial cost:
$140 - $14 = $126

Next, we need to add the cost of the additional insurance coverage, which is $5 per day. For 4 days, this would be:
4 days * $5/day = $20

Adding the insurance cost to the discounted rental cost gives us:
$126 + $20 = $146

Now we know that the cost of the rental and insurance without the mileage charge is $146. The total invoice Maria received was $192.50, so the cost for the miles driven is the difference between the total invoice and the cost of rental and insurance:
$192.50 - $146 = $46.50

This $46.50 is the amount charged for the miles driven at a rate of $0.09 per mile. To find out how many miles Maria drove, we divide the cost for miles by the rate per mile:
$46.50 / $0.09/mile = 516.67 miles

Since it's not possible to drive a fraction of a mile in this context, we can round the number of miles to the nearest whole number. Maria drove approximately 517 miles during her rental period.","Maria's invoice indicates that the daily rate and insurance fee totaled $35 * 4 days + $5 * 4 days = $140 for the four days.

This leaves $192.50 - $140 = $52.50 to cover the mileage fees.

At a rate of $0.09 per mile, Maria drove $52.50 / $0.09 = 583 miles.

The final result is 583 miles.","Let's break down the costs to understand how much Maria paid for each component of the rental.

First, let's calculate the cost of the rental without the insurance coverage plan:

Daily rate for 4 days = $35/day * 4 days = $140

Now, let's calculate the cost of the insurance coverage plan:

Insurance coverage plan = $5/day * 4 days = $20

Now, let's add the cost of the rental and the insurance coverage plan together:

Total cost without discount = $140 (rental) + $20 (insurance) = $160

Now, let's apply the 10% discount for rentals lasting 3 days or more:

Discount = 10% of $160 = 0.10 * $160 = $16

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost:

Final cost = $160 (total cost) - $16 (discount) = $144

Now, let's find out how much Maria paid for the insurance coverage plan:

Insurance coverage plan = $20

Now, let's subtract the cost of the insurance coverage plan from the final cost to get the cost of the rental:

Cost of rental = $144 (final cost) - $20 (insurance) = $124

Now, let's calculate the total miles Maria drove during the rental period:

Total miles = $124 (cost of rental) / $0.09/mile = 1377.78 miles

Since we can't have a fraction of a mile, we'll round to the nearest whole number:

Total miles = 1378 miles

So, Maria drove approximately 1378 miles during the rental period.",583,1378,517
901,"An ice skating rink charges 5 dollars for admission and 2.50 dollars to rent skates. Jill can purchase a new pair of skates for 65 dollars. However, she also needs to consider the sales tax that applies to the purchase of new skates, which is 9%. If she purchases skates, she can only expect them to remain in good condition for a period of two years. Taking into account the cost and life expectancy of new skates as well as the rental fees, how many times would she need to go to the rink to justify buying the skates rather than renting a pair over a period of two years?","First, let's calculate the total cost of purchasing new skates including the sales tax. 

The sales tax on the skates is 9% of $65, which is:
0.09 * $65 = $5.85

So the total cost of the skates including tax is:
$65 + $5.85 = $70.85

Now, let's calculate the cost of renting skates each time Jill goes to the rink. The cost to rent skates is $2.50 per visit.

To find out how many times Jill would need to go to the rink to justify buying the skates, we need to divide the total cost of the skates by the cost of renting skates per visit:

$70.85 / $2.50 = 28.34

Since Jill can't go to the rink a fraction of a time, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. 

Jill would need to go to the rink 29 times over the period of two years to justify buying the skates instead of renting.","To justify the expense of buying skates, Jill needs to skate more than 13 times over the two years.

The first step is to calculate the total cost of buying skates, which includes the price of the skates and the sales tax: 65 + 65 x 9% = 70.55. 

Next, we determine the total cost of renting skates for 13 sessions, which is 13 x 2.50 = 32.50. 

Now we compare the two options: buying skates is more justified if the total cost of renting for 13 sessions is higher than the cost of buying skates. 32.50 > 70.55. 

The result is 13.","First, let's calculate the total cost of renting skates for two years. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, and Jill can go to the rink once a week, she can go 52 times in a year. Over two years, she can go 104 times.

The cost to rent skates for one visit is $2.50. To find the total cost for two years, we multiply the cost per visit by the number of visits:

Total cost to rent skates for two years = $2.50/visit * 104 visits = $258

Now, let's calculate the total cost to purchase new skates, including the sales tax. The sales tax is 9% of the purchase price, so we calculate 9% of $65:

Sales tax = 9% of $65 = 0.09 * $65 = $5.85

The total cost to purchase new skates, including the sales tax, is:

Total cost to purchase new skates = $65 + $5.85 = $70.85

Now, let's compare the total cost to rent skates for two years to the total cost to purchase new skates. If the total cost to purchase new skates is less than the total cost to rent skates for two years, it would justify buying the skates.

Total cost to purchase new skates < Total cost to rent skates for two years

What is the minimum number of T-shirts with each customization option that you must sell to break even?","To calculate the break-even point for each customization option, we need to determine the total cost for each type of T-shirt and then find out how many of each type need to be sold to cover the initial investment of $1,500.

Let's calculate the cost and profit for each type of T-shirt:

Option 1:
Cost of T-shirt: $3
Cost of customization: $2
Total cost: $3 + $2 = $5
Selling price: $20
Profit per T-shirt: $20 - $5 = $15

Option 2:
Cost of T-shirt: $3
Cost of customization: $3
Total cost: $3 + $3 = $6
Selling price: $25
Profit per T-shirt: $25 - $6 = $19

Option 3:
Cost of T-shirt: $3
Cost of customization: $5
Total cost: $3 + $5 = $8
Selling price: $30
Profit per T-shirt: $30 - $8 = $22

Now, we'll calculate the minimum number of T-shirts that need to be sold for each option to break even:

Option 1:
Break-even point = Initial investment / Profit per T-shirt
Break-even point = $1,500 / $15
Break-even point = 100 T-shirts

Option 2:
Break-even point = Initial investment / Profit per T-shirt
Break-even point = $1,500 / $19
Break-even point ≈ 79 T-shirts (since you can't sell a fraction of a T-shirt, you would need to sell 80 T-shirts to break even)

Option 3:
Break-even point = Initial investment / Profit per T-shirt
Break-even point = $1,500 / $22
Break-even point ≈ 68 T-shirts (since you can't sell a fraction of a T-shirt, you would need to sell 69 T-shirts to break even)

Cost of T-shirt = 3 dollars
Total cost = 3 dollars + 3 dollars = 6 dollars

Option 3:
Cost of customization = 5 dollars
Cost of T-shirt = 3 dollars
Total cost = 5 dollars + 3 dollars = 8 dollars

Now, let's calculate the total revenue for each customization option when you sell the T-shirts at the given prices:

Option 1:
Revenue per T-shirt = 20 dollars

Option 2:
Revenue per T-shirt = 25 dollars

Option 3:
Revenue per T-shirt = 30 dollars

Now, let's calculate the minimum number of T-shirts with each customization option that you must sell to break even:

Option 1:
Total cost = 5 dollars
Revenue per T-shirt = 20 dollars
Minimum number of T-shirts to break even = Total cost / Revenue per T-shirt
Minimum number of T-shirts = 5 dollars / 20 dollars = 0.25
Since you can't sell a fraction of a T-shirt, you would need to sell at least 1 T-shirt with Option 1 to break even.

Option 2:
Total cost = 6 dollars
Revenue per T-shirt = 25 dollars
Minimum number of T-shirts = 6 dollars / 25 dollars = 0.24
Since you can't sell a fraction of a T-shirt, you would need to sell at least 1 T-shirt with Option 2 to break even.

0.5x = 2 * (0.25x + y)

Now, let's solve for y in terms of x:

0.5x = 2 * (0.25x + y)
0.5x = 0.5x + 2y
0.5x - 0.5x = 2y
0 = 2y

This implies that y = 0.

Now, since y is 0, we can plug this back into the original equation to find x:

0.5x = 2 * (0.25x + 0)
0.5x = 2 * 0.25x
0.5x = 0.5x

This equation is true for any value of x, meaning that x can be any number. However, since y is 0, the first number can be any number, and the second number is 0.","Let's break this down:
1. 0.5x = 2 * (0.25x + y)
2. Combining like terms, we get x = 4y

2x + y = 10 would be the desired equation after multiplying both sides by 2, but we need two equations to solve for both variables. Luckily, we can also derive from the original equation that 0.5x = 1.5y, or 2y = x.

2. Subtracting this new equation from the first one we derived gives us:
x - 2y = 0.5x
3. Solving for y yields: y = 1.5

Now, let's solve for x and y:

0.5x = 0.5x + 0.5y
0.5y = 0.5x - 0.5y

Now, we have a system of two equations:

1) 0.5x = 0.5x + 0.5y
2) 0.5y = 0.5x - 0.5y

To solve for x and y, we need to express y in terms of x in the first equation and then substitute that expression into the second equation.

From the first equation, we can express y in terms of x:

0.5y = 0.5x - 0.5y
0.5y = 0.5x
y = x

Now, we substitute y = x into the second equation:

0.5y = 0.5x - 0.5y
0.5x = 0.5x - 0.5x
0.5x = 0

Total cost for pencils = 9 dollars/carton * number of cartons of pencils
Total cost for erasers = 5 dollars/carton * number of cartons of erasers
Total cost for sharpeners = 7 dollars/carton * number of cartons of sharpeners

Since we are given the total cost of the order, we can set up an equation to find the number of cartons of pencils:

Total cost for pencils + Total cost for erasers + Total cost for sharpeners = Total cost of the order

Now, let's plug in the given values:

9 dollars/carton * number of cartons of pencils + 5 dollars/carton * number of cartons of erasers + 7 dollars/carton * number of cartons of sharpeners = 1,400 dollars

We know the total number of cartons is 200, so we can express the number of cartons of pencils as a fraction of the total number of cartons:

Number of cartons of pencils = (Total number of cartons * Total cost for pencils) / (Total cost for pencils + Total cost for erasers + Total cost for sharpeners)

Now, let's plug in the values:

Number of cartons of pencils = (200 * 9 dollars/carton) / (9 dollars/carton + 5 dollars/carton + 7 dollars/carton)

Number of cartons of pencils = (200 * 9) / (9 + 5 + 7)

Number of cartons of pencils = 1,800 / (9 + 5 + 7)

Number of cartons of pencils = 1,800 / 21

Number of cartons of pencils = 85.71428571428571

Since we can't have a fraction of a carton, we'll round to the nearest whole number. The number of cartons of pencils is approximately 86.",50,86,P.
905,One gallon container is full of a 75% alcohol solution. How much must be drained off and replaced by a 42% alcohol solution to produce one gallon of a 62% alcohol solution?,"Let's denote the amount of the 75% alcohol solution to be drained and replaced by x gallons.

When we drain x gallons of the 75% solution, we remove 0.75x gallons of pure alcohol. After replacing it with x gallons of the 42% solution, we add 0.42x gallons of pure alcohol.

The original 1 gallon of 75% alcohol solution contains 0.75 gallons of pure alcohol. After the replacement, we want to have a 62% alcohol solution in a 1 gallon mixture, which means we want 0.62 gallons of pure alcohol in the final mixture.

The equation representing the final amount of pure alcohol after the replacement is:

Original pure alcohol - Removed pure alcohol + Added pure alcohol = Final pure alcohol
0.75 - 0.75x + 0.42x = 0.62

Now, let's solve for x:

0.75 - 0.75x + 0.42x = 0.62
0.75 - 0.33x = 0.62
-0.33x = 0.62 - 0.75
-0.33x = -0.13
x = -0.13 / -0.33
x ≈ 0.3939 gallons

So, approximately 0.3939 gallons of the 75% alcohol solution must be drained off and replaced by the 42% alcohol solution to produce one gallon of a 62% alcohol solution.","We start with a gallon of 75% alcohol solution. To obtain a 62% solution, we need to remove some of the current liquid and replace it with a weaker solution.

75% of the current solution is equal to 3/4, while 62% is equal to 11/20. We set up the following equation:

3/4C = 11/20 + x

We solve for x and obtain a value of 1/5C. This means that we need to drain off 1/5 of the gallon and replace it with an equal amount of the 42% alcohol solution.

**1/5**","Let's denote the amount of the 75% alcohol solution that needs to be drained off as x gallons. After draining off x gallons, the remaining solution will be (1 - x) gallons.

To produce one gallon of a 62% alcohol solution, we need to replace the x gallons of the 75% alcohol solution with x gallons of the 42% alcohol solution.

The amount of alcohol in the 75% solution that needs to be drained off is 75% of x gallons, which is 0.75x gallons.

The amount of alcohol in the 42% solution that needs to be added is 42% of x gallons, which is 0.42x gallons.

The total amount of alcohol in the final solution should be 62% of one gallon, which is 0.62 gallons.

So, we have the equation:

0.75x + 0.42x = 0.62

Combining like terms, we get:

1.17x = 0.62

Now, we solve for x:

x = 0.62 / 1.17
x = 0.53

So, 0.53 gallons of the 75% alcohol solution need to be drained off and replaced by 0.53 gallons of the 42% alcohol solution to produce one gallon of a 62% alcohol solution.",1/5,0.53,0.3939
906,0.5 * sqrt(x) is 10 more than 0.1667 * x^2. Find the number x.,"To find the value of x, we need to set up an equation based on the given information:

0.5 * sqrt(x) = 0.1667 * x^2 + 10

Now, let's solve for x:

0.5 * sqrt(x) - 0.1667 * x^2 = 10

To make it easier to solve, let's get rid of the square root by squaring both sides of the equation:

(0.5 * sqrt(x))^2 = (0.1667 * x^2 + 10)^2

0.25 * x = (0.1667 * x^2 + 10)^2

0.25 * x = 0.1667^2 * x^4 + 2 * 0.1667 * 10 * x^2 + 10^2

0.25 * x = 0.02778889 * x^4 + 3.334 * x^2 + 100

0.02778889 * x^4 + 3.334 * x^2 - 0.25 * x + 100 = 0

This is a quartic equation, which can be challenging to solve by hand. We can use numerical methods or a graphing calculator to find the roots of the equation. However, since we are looking for a real and positive solution (because x is under a square root), we can try to simplify the equation further or use an approximation method.

Let's rearrange the terms to have them in descending order of powers of x:

0.02778889 * x^4 + 3.334 * x^2 - 0.25 * x + 100 = 0

This equation does not have an easy analytical solution, so we will use numerical methods to approximate the value of x.

0.5 * sqrt(y) - 0.1667 * y^2 = 10
0.5 * sqrt(y) = 10 + 0.1667 * y^2

You are planning a 3-day trip with daily budgets of 90 dollars for Day 1, 75 dollars for Day 2, and 80 dollars for Day 3. How many miles can you drive each day to stay within your allocated budget for each day?","Let's calculate the total cost for renting the car for one day without considering the miles driven:

Car rental per day: $45
Insurance fee per day: $15
Total rental fee before tax: $45 + $15 = $60

Now, let's calculate the 8% local sales tax on the total rental fee:

Sales tax: 8% of $60 = 0.08 * $60 = $4.8

So, the total cost for renting the car for one day without miles is:

Total cost per day without miles: $60 + $4.8 = $64.8

Now, let's calculate the cost per mile:

Cost per mile: $0.28

We need to calculate how many miles you can drive each day to stay within your daily budget. We'll subtract the total cost per day without miles from your daily budget to find out how much is left for miles.

Day 1:
Budget: $90
Remaining for miles: $90 - $64.8 = $25.2

Day 2:
Budget: $75
Remaining for miles: $75 - $64.8 = $10.2

Day 3:
Budget: $80
Remaining for miles: $80 - $64.8 = $15.2

Now, we'll divide the remaining budget for each day by the cost per mile to find out how many miles you can drive.

Day 1 miles:
$25.2 / $0.28 = 90 miles

Day 2 miles:
$10.2 / $0.28 = 36.43 miles (Since you can't drive a fraction of a mile, you can drive up to 36 miles)

Day 3 miles:
$15.2 / $0.28 = 54.29 miles (Again, rounding down, you can drive up to 54 miles)

So, you can drive up to 90 miles on Day 1, 36 miles on Day 2, and 54 miles on Day 3 to stay within your allocated budget for each day.","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the car rental per day, including all additional costs, and then determine the maximum miles that can be driven while staying within the daily budgets.

Step 1: Calculate the total daily cost of car rental.
$45 (base fee) + $15 (insurance fee) = $60 per day

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for three days.
$60 x 3 = $180

Step 3: Calculate the 8% local sales tax.
0.08 x $180 = $14.40

Step 4: Add the sales tax to the total cost.
$180 + $14.40 = $194.40

Step 5: Divide the daily budget by the total daily cost to find the maximum number of days可 driven while staying within the budget.
Day 1: $90 / $194.40 = 0.46 days
Day 2: $75 / $194.40 = 0.38 days
Day 3: $80 / $194.40 = 0.41 days

Step 6: Calculate the maximum miles driven per day, considering each day's budget.
0.46 days x 28 cents/mile = 13.04 cents/mile
0.38 days x 28 cents/mile = 10.64 cents/mile
0.41 days x 28 cents/mile = 11.48 cents/mile

The maximum miles you can drive each day while staying within your budget are approximately 13, 11, and 12 miles for Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3, respectively. 

The final result is 11.","First, let's calculate the total cost for each day based on the given budgets.

For Day 1:
- Rental fee: 45 dollars
- Insurance fee: 15 dollars
- Sales tax: 8% of (45 + 15) = 8% of 60 = 4.8 dollars
- Total for Day 1: 45 + 15 + 4.8 = 64.8 dollars

For Day 2:
- Rental fee: 45 dollars
- Insurance fee: 15 dollars
- Sales tax: 8% of (45 + 15) = 8% of 60 = 4.8 dollars
- Total for Day 2: 45 + 15 + 4.8 = 64.8 dollars

For Day 3:
- Rental fee: 45 dollars
- Insurance fee: 15 dollars
- Sales tax: 8% of (45 + 15) = 8% of 60 = 4.8 dollars
- Total for Day 3: 45 + 15 + 4.8 = 64.8 dollars

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the entire trip:
- Total for the trip: 64.8 (Day 1) + 64.8 (Day 2) + 64.8 (Day 3) = 194.4 dollars

Next, we need to calculate the cost per mile for the rental car. The cost per mile is the total cost minus the fixed costs (rental fee and insurance fee) and then divided by the number of miles driven.

Cost per mile = (Total cost - Fixed costs) / Miles driven

For the entire trip:
- Total cost: 194.4 dollars
- Fixed costs: 45 (rental fee) + 15 (insurance fee) = 60 dollars
- Cost per mile: (194.4 - 60) / Miles driven

Now, let's calculate the cost per mile for each day:

For Day 1:
- Cost per mile: (64.8 - 60) / Miles driven
- Cost per mile: 4.8 / Miles driven

For Day 2:
- Cost per mile: (64.8 - 60) / Miles driven
- Cost per mile: 4.8 / Miles driven

For Day 3:
- Cost per mile: (64.8 - 60) / Miles driven

John plans to buy a combination of these apples to make a fruit salad, such that the total weight of the apples is exactly 7 pounds. If John buys 2 pounds of Royal Gala apples and 3 pounds of Fuji apples, how much will he spend on Honeycrisp apples, and what is his total expenditure on all apples purchased?","First, let's calculate the cost of the Royal Gala and Fuji apples that John plans to buy.

For the Royal Gala apples:
2 pounds * $2.50 per pound = $5.00

For the Fuji apples:
3 pounds * $1.80 per pound = $5.40

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of Honeycrisp apples John will buy to reach the total weight of 7 pounds. He has already bought 2 pounds of Royal Gala and 3 pounds of Fuji apples, which adds up to 5 pounds. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 pounds - 5 pounds = 2 pounds of Honeycrisp apples.

The cost of the Honeycrisp apples will be:
2 pounds * $3.20 per pound = $6.40

Now, let's calculate the total expenditure on all apples:

Cost of Royal Gala apples: $5.00
Cost of Fuji apples: $5.40
Cost of Honeycrisp apples: $6.40

Total expenditure = $5.00 + $5.40 + $6.40 = $16.80

John will spend $6.40 on Honeycrisp apples, and his total expenditure on all apples will be $16.80.","John will need to buy 2 pounds of Honeycrisp apples to reach the target weight of 7 pounds. The cost would be 6.40 dollars. 

Therefore, John's total expenditure on apples will amount to 16.20 dollars.","John has already bought 2 pounds of Royal Gala apples and 3 pounds of Fuji apples, which means he has 4 pounds left to buy Honeycrisp apples to make the total weight of the apples 7 pounds.

The cost of Honeycrisp apples is 3.20 dollars per pound. To find out how much John will spend on Honeycrisp apples, we need to calculate the cost per pound and then multiply it by the number of pounds he will buy.

Cost per pound of Honeycrisp apples = 3.20 dollars

Since John has 4 pounds left to buy, we multiply the cost per pound by the number of pounds:

Cost on Honeycrisp apples = 3.20 dollars/pound * 4 pounds
Cost on Honeycrisp apples = 12.80 dollars

Now, let's calculate the total expenditure on all apples purchased:

Total expenditure on all apples = Cost on Royal Gala apples + Cost on Fuji apples + Cost on Honeycrisp apples
Total expenditure on all apples = 2.50 dollars/pound * 2 pounds + 1.80 dollars/pound * 3 pounds + 12.80 dollars
Total expenditure on all apples = 5 dollars + 5.40 dollars + 12.80 dollars
Total expenditure on all apples = 23.20 dollars

So, John will spend 12.80 dollars on Honeycrisp apples, and his total expenditure on all apples purchased will be 23.20 dollars.",16.20,Twenty three dollars and twenty cents,sixteen dollars and eighty cents

Kathy sells group tickets for $15.00 each and family tickets for $12.50 each. If their total income for the day is $325.00 from selling 75 tickets, how many of each type of ticket did Ron and Kathy sell?","Let's denote the number of student tickets sold by Ron as \( s \), adult tickets as \( a \), and senior tickets as \( sr \). Similarly, let's denote the number of group tickets sold by Kathy as \( g \), and family tickets as \( f \).

The total number of tickets sold by Ron and Kathy is 75, so we have the equation:
\[ s + a + sr + g + f = 75 \] (1)

The total income for the day is $325.00, so we have the equation:
\[ 2s + 4.5a + 3.5sr + 15g + 12.5f = 325 \] (2)

We now have two equations but five unknowns, which means we have an underdetermined system. To solve this, we would need additional information or constraints to find a unique solution. However, we can try to express the number of tickets in terms of one variable and see if we can find a combination that satisfies both the total number of tickets and the total income.

Let's express \( g \) and \( f \) in terms of \( s \), \( a \), and \( sr \):
\[ g + f = 75 - (s + a + sr) \] (3)

Substituting equation (3) into equation (2) gives us:
\[ 2s + 4.5a + 3.5sr + 15(75 - (s + a + sr)) + 12.5(75 - (s + a + sr)) = 325 \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 2s + 4.5a + 3.5sr + 1125 - 15s - 15a - 15sr + 937.5 - 12.5s - 12.5a - 12.5sr = 325 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ -25.5s - 23.5a - 24.5sr + 2062.5 = 325 \]

Simplifying further, we get:
\[ -25.5s - 23.5a - 24.5sr = -1737.5 \]

This equation still has three unknowns, and without additional constraints, we cannot find a unique solution. We would need to know at least two of the variables to solve for the third one. If we had information such as ""Ron sold twice as many student tickets as adult tickets,"" or ""Kathy sold the same number of group and family tickets,"" we could proceed to find a unique solution. Without such constraints, there are multiple combinations of ticket sales that could result in the total income of $325.00 from selling 75 tickets.","Let's analyze Ron's earnings first:
Student tickets: $2.00 x number of tickets = unknown
Adult tickets: $4.50 x number of tickets = unknown
Senior tickets: $3.50 x number of tickets = unknown

Let's assume the number of student tickets sold is x.

Now let's look at Kathy's earnings:
Group tickets: $15.00 x number of tickets = unknown
Family tickets: $12.50 x number of tickets = unknown

Assuming the number of group tickets sold is y, we get:
15 * y = unknown
12.5 * z = unknown

Ron + Kathy = $325.00
2x + 4.5x + 3.5x + 15y + 12.5z = $325.00

We can solve this system of equations by first simplifying:
9x + 15y + 12.5z = $325

Next, we identify two values that would help us solve for the third unknown. We see that 9x + 15y = $300, while 12.5z = $25.
This means that x + y = $300/$9 = 33 1/3, while z = $25/$12.5 = 2.

Now we can solve for z, which is 2. This means Kathy sold 2 group tickets.
With the value of y now known, we can solve for x. x + 33 1/3 = 75 - 33 1/3 = 41 2/3. So x = 40.

- Ron's student tickets: S
- Ron's adult tickets: A
- Ron's senior tickets: Sr
- Kathy's group tickets: G

We know that Ron sells three types of tickets, and Kathy sells two types of tickets. So we have a total of 3 + 2 = 5 types of tickets.

We also know that the total income for the day is $325.00, and this is from selling 75 tickets. So the average income per ticket is:

$325.00 / 75 tickets = $4.33 per ticket

- Ron's senior tickets: Sr * $3.50 = $3.50Sr
- Kathy's group tickets: G * $15.00 = $15.00G
- Kathy's family tickets: F * $12.50 = $12.50F

For Ron:
$2.00S + $4.50A + $3.50Sr = $4.33

For Kathy:
$15.00G + $12.50F = $4.33

From the third year onwards, the growth rate of the tree decreases by 1 foot each year until it reaches a minimum growth rate of 1 foot per year. How many years will it take for the tree to be at least 29 feet tall?","Let's calculate the height of the tree year by year until it reaches at least 29 feet.

Initial height: 4 feet

After 1st year: 4 feet + 5 feet = 9 feet
After 2nd year: 9 feet + 4 feet = 13 feet

Starting from the 3rd year, the growth rate decreases by 1 foot each year until it reaches a minimum of 1 foot per year.

After 3rd year: 13 feet + (4 - 1) feet = 13 feet + 3 feet = 16 feet
After 4th year: 16 feet + (3 - 1) feet = 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet
After 5th year: 18 feet + (2 - 1) feet = 18 feet + 1 foot = 19 feet

From the 5th year onwards, the tree will grow at a rate of 1 foot per year because the growth rate has reached the minimum.

We need the tree to be at least 29 feet tall, and it is currently 19 feet tall after 5 years. So we need an additional 29 - 19 = 10 feet of growth.

Since the tree grows at a rate of 1 foot per year from now on, it will take 10 more years to grow the additional 10 feet.

Therefore, the total number of years it will take for the tree to be at least 29 feet tall is 5 years (already calculated) + 10 years (additional growth) = 15 years.","Tony's tree will take 11 years to reach a height of 29 feet.

We sum the length the tree grows each year for a total of 11 years, which is enough time for the tree to grow one extra foot than needed:

(1 x 11) + (4 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 1) = 29

So, the answer is 11.","Let's calculate the height of the tree each year:

First year: 4 feet (initial height) + 5 feet (growth rate) = 9 feet
Second year: 9 feet (height at the end of the first year) + 4 feet (growth rate) = 13 feet

From the third year onwards, the growth rate decreases by 1 foot each year until it reaches a minimum growth rate of 1 foot per year.

Let's calculate the height of the tree each year from the third year onwards:

Third year: 13 feet (height at the end of the second year) + 3 feet (decreasing growth rate) = 16 feet
Fourth year: 16 feet (height at the end of the third year) + 2 feet (decreasing growth rate) = 18 feet
Fifth year: 18 feet (height at the end of the fourth year) + 1 foot (decreasing growth rate) = 19 feet

Now, let's calculate the total height of the tree after the fifth year:

Total height = Initial height + (First year growth + Second year growth + Third year growth + Fourth year growth + Fifth year growth)
Total height = 4 feet + (5 feet + 4 feet + 3 feet + 2 feet + 1 foot)
Total height = 4 feet + 19 feet
Total height = 23 feet

Since the tree is already 9 feet tall at the end of the first year, we need to add the growth from the second year to reach the 29 feet mark:

Total height = 9 feet (height at the end of the first year) + 4 feet (growth in the second year)
Total height = 13 feet

Now, let's add the growth from the third year onwards to reach the 29 feet mark:

Total height = 13 feet (height at the end of the second year) + 3 feet (growth in the third year) + 2 feet (growth in the fourth year) + 1 foot (growth in the fifth year)
Total height = 13 feet + 6 feet

911,"A painting is 10 inches tall and 15 inches wide on canvas A, and the same painting is printed on two different canvases, canvas B and canvas C. On canvas B, the painting is scaled such that its height is 25 inches and the width maintains the original aspect ratio. On canvas C, the height of the painting is 18 inches and the width also maintains the original aspect ratio. Additionally, each side of the painting on canvas C is surrounded by a 3-inch-wide frame. Calculate the width of the painting on canvas B and find the total dimensions, including the frame, of the painting on canvas C.","To calculate the width of the painting on canvas B, we need to maintain the original aspect ratio of the painting. The original aspect ratio is the width divided by the height. Let's calculate that first:

Original aspect ratio = original width / original height
Original aspect ratio = 15 inches / 10 inches
Original aspect ratio = 1.5

Now, we can use this aspect ratio to find the width of the painting on canvas B, where the height is 25 inches:

Width on canvas B = height on canvas B * original aspect ratio
Width on canvas B = 25 inches * 1.5
Width on canvas B = 37.5 inches

So, the width of the painting on canvas B is 37.5 inches.

Next, let's find the total dimensions of the painting on canvas C, including the frame. We already know that the height of the painting on canvas C is 18 inches, and we need to maintain the original aspect ratio to find the width:

Width on canvas C = height on canvas C * original aspect ratio
Width on canvas C = 18 inches * 1.5
Width on canvas C = 27 inches

Now, we need to add the width of the frame to each side of the painting on canvas C. Since the frame is 3 inches wide, we will add 3 inches to each side for both the height and the width:

Total height on canvas C = height of painting + 2 * frame width
Total height on canvas C = 18 inches + 2 * 3 inches
Total height on canvas C = 18 inches + 6 inches
Total height on canvas C = 24 inches

Total width on canvas C = width of painting + 2 * frame width
Total width on canvas C = 27 inches + 2 * 3 inches
Total width on canvas C = 27 inches + 6 inches
Total width on canvas C = 33 inches

Therefore, the total dimensions of the painting on canvas C, including the frame, are 24 inches tall and 33 inches wide.","We're asked to find the width of a painting on canvas B and the total dimensions of the painting, including the frame, on canvas C.

The original painting has a height of 10 inches and a width of 15 inches. We'll call this ratio A.

Canvas B scales the painting's height to 25 inches while maintaining the original aspect ratio A. To find the width, we set up a proportion using the two ratios:

25/10 = x/15

Solving for x gives us a width of 37.5 inches on canvas B.

Now to find the total dimensions of the painting on canvas C. The height of the painting is 18 inches, and each side has a 3-inch frame. The width also maintains the original aspect ratio A, so we have:

18/10 = x/15

Solving gives us a width of 27 inches for the painting on canvas C. Adding the 3-inch frame to each side gives us final dimensions of 33 inches.

So the answers are:
37.5 inches and 33 inches.

**37.5** **and** **33**","Let's denote the original aspect ratio of the painting as \( \frac{h}{w} \), where \( h \) is the height and \( w \) is the width.

Given that the original painting is 10 inches tall and 15 inches wide, the aspect ratio is \( \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3} \).

Now, let's find the width of the painting on canvas B, which maintains the original aspect ratio. Since the height of the painting on canvas B is 25 inches, the width can be found by multiplying the height by the inverse of the aspect ratio:

\( w = \frac{h}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{h}{\frac{2}{3}} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{h \times 3}{2} \)

Substituting the height of 25 inches, we get:

\( w = \frac{25 \times 3}{2} = \frac{75}{2} = 37.5 \) inches

So, the width of the painting on canvas B is 37.5 inches.

Now, let's find the total dimensions, including the frame, of the painting on canvas C. The height of the painting on canvas C is 18 inches, and the width maintains the original aspect ratio. Therefore, the width of the painting on canvas C is:

\( w = \frac{h}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{18}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{18 \times 3}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \) inches

The frame around each side of the painting is 3 inches wide, so the total width of the painting on canvas C, including the frame, is:

\( w + 2 \times 3 = 27 + 2 \times 3 = 27 + 6 = 33 \) inches

Therefore, the total dimensions, including the frame, of the painting on canvas C are 18 inches tall and 33 inches wide.",37.5 and 33,33.,33
912,"Safety Rent A Truck costs 41.95 dollars plus 0.29 dollars per mile. City Rentals rents the truck for 38.95 dollars plus 0.31 dollars per mile. A third rental company, Metro Van Hire, charges 44.95 dollars plus 0.27 dollars per mile. For what mileage are the costs the same for all three companies?","To find the mileage at which the costs are the same for all three companies, we need to set up an equation for each company and then equate them to find the common mileage.

Let's denote the mileage as \( m \).

For Safety Rent A Truck, the cost \( C_1 \) is:
\[ C_1 = 41.95 + 0.29m \]

For City Rentals, the cost \( C_2 \) is:
\[ C_2 = 38.95 + 0.31m \]

For Metro Van Hire, the cost \( C_3 \) is:
\[ C_3 = 44.95 + 0.27m \]

We want to find the mileage \( m \) where \( C_1 = C_2 = C_3 \).

First, let's equate \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \):
\[ 41.95 + 0.29m = 38.95 + 0.31m \]

Solving for \( m \):
\[ 0.29m - 0.31m = 38.95 - 41.95 \]
\[ -0.02m = -3 \]
\[ m = \frac{-3}{-0.02} \]
\[ m = 150 \]

So, at 150 miles, Safety Rent A Truck and City Rentals cost the same.

Now, let's equate \( C_1 \) and \( C_3 \):
\[ 41.95 + 0.29m = 44.95 + 0.27m \]

Solving for \( m \):
\[ 0.29m - 0.27m = 44.95 - 41.95 \]
\[ 0.02m = 3 \]
\[ m = \frac{3}{0.02} \]
\[ m = 150 \]

So, at 150 miles, Safety Rent A Truck and Metro Van Hire cost the same.

Finally, let's check if City Rentals and Metro Van Hire also cost the same at 150 miles:
\[ C_2 = 38.95 + 0.31 \times 150 \]
\[ C_2 = 38.95 + 46.5 \]
\[ C_2 = 85.45 \]

\[ C_3 = 44.95 + 0.27 \times 150 \]
\[ C_3 = 44.95 + 40.5 \]
\[ C_3 = 85.45 \]

Indeed, at 150 miles, all three companies charge the same amount, which is $85.45.","We have three equations based on the given rental costs:
1. Safety Rent A Truck: 41.95 + 0.29x = cost
2. City Rentals: 38.95 + 0.31x = cost
3. Metro Van Hire: 44.95 + 0.27x = cost

We want to find the mileage where all three equations yield the same cost. To do this, we can set up the equations so that the cost terms are isolated on the left side, and the mileage terms are on the right:

1. 0.29x = -3.00 + 41.95
2. 0.31x = 41.95 - 38.95
3. 0.27x = 5.00 + 44.95

Solving for x:
1. x = (-3.00 + 41.95) / 0.29 = 141.83 miles
2. x = (41.95 - 38.95) / 0.31 = 102.58 miles
3. x = (5.00 + 44.95) / 0.27 = 195.70 miles

The mileage where the costs are the same for all three companies is the intersection of these solutions: 102.58 miles and 141.83 miles. This gives us:

115 miles

As a single number, the solution is 115.","To find the mileage at which the costs are the same for all three companies, we need to set up an equation that represents the total cost for each company and then set it equal to the total cost for the other two companies.

Let's denote the mileage as \( M \).

The total cost for Safety Rent A Truck is:
\( 41.95 + 0.29M \)

The total cost for City Rentals is:
\( 38.95 + 0.31M \)

The total cost for Metro Van Hire is:
\( 44.95 + 0.27M \)

Now, we set the total cost for Safety Rent A Truck equal to the total cost for City Rentals and Metro Van Hire:
\( 41.95 + 0.29M = 38.95 + 0.31M + 44.95 + 0.27M \)

Now, we combine like terms:
\( 41.95 + 0.29M = 38.95 + 0.31M + 44.95 + 0.27M \)
\( 41.95 + 0.29M + 38.95 + 0.31M + 44.95 + 0.27M = 38.95 + 0.31M + 44.95 + 0.27M \)
\( 80.90 + 0.58M = 80.90 + 0.58M \)

Since the terms with \( M \) cancel out, we are left with:
\( 80.90 = 80.90 \)

This equation is true for any value of \( M \), which means the costs are the same for all three companies at any mileage.",115,80.90,150
913,"There were four types of tickets sold for the Class of 2003 ice cream picnic: student, non-student, family, and VIP. In total, 275 tickets were sold and $420 was collected. The ticket costs were:

1. Student tickets: $0.50 each
2. Non-student tickets: $1.50 each
3. Family tickets: $3.00 each
4. VIP tickets: $5.00 each

Let x be the number of student tickets sold, y be the number of non-student tickets sold, z be the number of family tickets sold, and w be the number of VIP tickets sold. 

Create a system of linear equations based on the given information and find how many student, non-student, family, and VIP tickets were sold.","To create a system of linear equations based on the given information, we can use the following two pieces of information:

1. The total number of tickets sold was 275.
2. The total amount of money collected was $420.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:

x + y + z + w = 275  (Equation 1)

This equation represents the total number of tickets sold.

From the second piece of information, we can write the equation based on the cost of each type of ticket:

0.50x + 1.50y + 3.00z + 5.00w = 420  (Equation 2)

This equation represents the total amount of money collected from the sale of the tickets.

Now we have a system of two equations with four variables (x, y, z, w). To solve for the number of each type of ticket sold, we need two more equations. However, with the information provided, we can't create two more independent equations, which means we can't find a unique solution for the number of each type of ticket sold.

In real-world scenarios, additional information would be needed to solve this system, such as knowing the number of at least two types of tickets sold or having a relationship between the numbers of different types of tickets. Without this information, the problem has infinitely many solutions.","We are asked to find the number of tickets sold for each category, which can be represented as follows:

1. 50x = number of student tickets sold
2. 150y = number of non-student tickets sold
3. 300z = number of family tickets sold
4. 500w = number of VIP tickets sold

We also have the total number of tickets sold and the total amount of money collected:

5. 275 = x + y + z + w
6. $420 = 50x + 150y + 300z + 500w

We can solve this system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination. First, we'll manipulate the equations to have a coefficient of 1 on the left side of each variable:

1. x = 2z + 3w
2. y = -x + z + 2w
3. $180 = 10x + 50y + 300z + 500w

Next, we'll solve each equation for one variable, substituting as needed:

- w = (275 - x - y - z) / 3
- y = -x + z + 2 * (275 - x - y - z) / 3
- $180 = 10x + 50 * (-x + z + 2w) + 300z + 500 * (275 - x - y - z) / 3

Substituting w in terms of other variables and simplifying:

- $180 = 190x + 230z - 375y + 13500 / 3 = 450x + 230z - 375y + 450

We can solve this system by first solving for y:

375y = 450 - 450x - 230z + 13500/3 -> y = 3 - 3x - z

Substituting this back into the first equation:

x = 2z + 3 * (3 - 3x - z) = 9 - 6x - 3z

We can solve this simultaneously with the third equation to find the values of x and z:

- 450x + 230z - 375 * (3 - 3x - z) + 13500/3 = 180

914,How many liters of a 65 % acid solution must be mixed with a 80 % acid solution to get 50 liters of a 76 % solution?,"Let's call the amount of the 65% acid solution needed ""x"" liters, and the amount of the 80% acid solution needed ""y"" liters.

We have two unknowns (x and y), so we need two equations to solve for them.

The first equation comes from the total volume of the final solution:
x + y = 50 (Equation 1)

The second equation comes from the concentration of acid in the final solution:
0.65x + 0.80y = 0.76 * 50 (Equation 2)

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously.

From Equation 1, we can express y in terms of x:
y = 50 - x (Equation 3)

Now we substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:
0.65x + 0.80(50 - x) = 0.76 * 50

Expanding the equation:
0.65x + 40 - 0.80x = 38

Combine like terms:
-0.15x + 40 = 38

Subtract 40 from both sides:
-0.15x = -2

Divide by -0.15 to solve for x:
x = -2 / -0.15
x = 13.33 liters (approximately)

Now we can find y using Equation 3:
y = 50 - x
y = 50 - 13.33
y = 36.67 liters (approximately)

So, approximately 13.33 liters of the 65% acid solution must be mixed with approximately 36.67 liters of the 80% acid solution to get 50 liters of a 76% solution.","To solve this, we should first determine the amount of pure acid in both solutions. The 65% acid solution has 0.65L of acid in 1L of solution and the 80% solution has 0.8L of acid per 1L of solution. We want to end up with 50L of a 76% acid solution. 

76% of 50L is 38L of acid. We now need to figure out how much acid the mixture of the two solutions will contain. We can find this by adding the acids, 0.65L and 0.8L of acid in every 1L of solution, and multiplying by the total volume of the mixture:
0.65 + 0.8 = 1.45L of acid in 1L of solution
1.45L of acid * 50L of solution = 72.5L of acid

Since we want 38L of acid in the final 50L solution, we can equate the two expressions for acid volume:
72.5L = 38L
The difference between the two volumes is the amount of the 65% acid solution that needs to be mixed with the 80% solution.

72.5L - 38L = 34.5L

The final answer is: 35.","To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of the 65% acid solution that, when mixed with the 80% acid solution, will result in 50 liters of a 76% acid solution.

First, let's find the amount of the 80% acid solution that will give us 50 liters of a 76% acid solution. Since the 80% acid solution is already close to the desired 76% solution, we can use the concept of dilution to find the amount of the 80% solution needed.

The amount of the 80% acid solution needed to make 50 liters of a 76% acid solution can be calculated using the formula for dilution:

C1V1 = C2V2

Where:
C1 = concentration of the first solution (80%)
V1 = volume of the first solution (in liters)
C2 = concentration of the second solution (76%)
V2 = volume of the second solution (in liters)

Let's plug in the values we have:

C1 = 80%
V1 = 50 liters (desired volume)
C2 = 76%
V2 = ? (volume of the 80% solution needed)

Now, let's solve for V2:

80% * 50 liters = 76% * V2 liters
0.80 * 50 = 0.76 * V2
40 = 0.76 * V2
V2 = 40 / 0.76
V2 = 52.63 liters

So, we need 52.63 liters of the 80% acid solution to make 50 liters of a 76% acid solution.

Now, let's find the amount of the 65% acid solution that, when mixed with the 52.63 liters of the 80% acid solution, will result in 50 liters of a 76% acid solution.

We can use the same dilution formula:

C1V1 = C2V2

Where:
C1 = concentration of the first solution (65%)
V1 = volume of the first solution (in liters)
C2 = concentration of the second solution (76%)
V2 = volume of the second solution (in liters)

Let's plug in the values we have:

C1 = 65%
V1 = ? (volume of the 65% solution needed)
C2 = 76%
V2 = 50 liters (desired volume)

The sum of 20 and x can be written as:
20 + x

This is equal to 30 more than three times the square of x, which can be written as:
3x^2 + 30

Now we can set up the equation:
20 + x = 3x^2 + 30

To solve for x, we need to rearrange the equation and set it to zero:
3x^2 + 30 - 20 - x = 0
3x^2 - x + 10 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. To solve for x, we can either factor the equation, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. However, this equation does not factor nicely, so let's use the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

In our equation, a = 3, b = -1, and c = 10. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

x = [-(-1) ± √((-1)^2 - 4(3)(10))] / (2(3))
x = [1 ± √(1 - 120)] / 6
x = [1 ± √(-119)] / 6

Since the discriminant (the part under the square root) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. The equation has complex solutions, but since we are likely looking for a real number solution, we can conclude that there is no real number x that satisfies the given condition.","Let's solve this math problem step by step.

We start with the given equation: 
$x + 20 = 30 + 3x^2

We need to find the value of x. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for x: 
$x + 10 = 3x^2

We can subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with x on the left side: 
$x = 3x^2 - 10

Now, we have a quadratic equation. We can divide the entire equation by 3 to simplify it: 
$x/3 = x^2 - 10/3

The solution to this equation is 5. So, x is equal to 5.

Therefore, the final result is 5.","Let's denote the number x as y for clarity.

According to the problem, the sum of 20 and y is 30 more than three times the square of y. We can write this as an equation:

20 + y = 3(y^2) + 30

Now, let's solve for y:

20 + y = 3y^2 + 30
y^2 + y - 10 = 0

This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first:

y^2 + y - 10 = (y + 2)(y - 5)

Now we have two factors, (y + 2) and (y - 5). We need to find values of y that make these factors equal to zero.

For (y + 2) to be zero, y must be -2. For (y - 5) to be zero, y must be 5.

However, we need to find a single value of y that makes both factors equal to zero. This is not possible because the two factors have different signs. When we add the two factors together, we get a quadratic equation with a positive term and a negative term, which cannot equal zero.

Since we cannot find a single value of y that makes both factors equal to zero, the equation y^2 + y - 10 = 0 has no real solutions. Therefore, there is no value of x that satisfies the given equation.",5,no solution,no real solutions
916,The sum of the squares of two times a number and another number is 116. The sum of these two numbers is 10. Find the numbers.,"Let's call the first number x and the second number y. According to the problem, we have two equations:

1) The sum of the squares of two times the first number and the second number is 116:
(2x)^2 + y^2 = 116

2) The sum of these two numbers is 10:
x + y = 10

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

From the second equation, we can express y in terms of x:
y = 10 - x

Now, let's substitute y in the first equation with the expression we found from the second equation:

(2x)^2 + (10 - x)^2 = 116
4x^2 + (100 - 20x + x^2) = 116
4x^2 + 100 - 20x + x^2 = 116
5x^2 - 20x + 100 = 116

Now, let's move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:

5x^2 - 20x + 100 - 116 = 0
5x^2 - 20x - 16 = 0

Now, we can solve for x using the quadratic formula, factoring, or completing the square. Let's try factoring:

(5x + 2)(x - 8) = 0

This gives us two possible solutions for x:
5x + 2 = 0  or  x - 8 = 0

Solving each equation for x gives us:
x = -2/5 (which we can discard as it does not lead to an integer solution for y) or x = 8

If x = 8, then we can find y by substituting x back into the second equation:
y = 10 - x
y = 10 - 8
y = 2

So the two numbers are x = 8 and y = 2.","We are asked to find two numbers whose squares added together equal 116 and whose sum is 10. To solve this, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares is 116 and the sum of the numbers is 10 to form two equations:
1. x^2 + y^2 = 116
2. x + y = 10

Solving this system of equations, we get x = 4 and y = 6.
So the numbers are 4 and 6.

The result: 4 and 6.","Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. According to the problem, we have:

(2x)^2 + y^2 = 116

First, let's square both sides of the equation:

(2x)^4 + y^4 = 116^2

Now, let's simplify the equation by squaring the terms:

(2x)^4 = 16x^4
y^4 = y^2 * y^2

So, the equation becomes:

16x^4 + y^4 = 1216

Now, let's consider the sum of the two numbers, which is given as 10:

x + y = 10

We can square this equation to get:

(x + y)^2 = 10^2

Now, let's substitute the value of x + y from the second equation into the first equation:

(10)^2 = 100

So, we have:

16x^4 + y^4 = 1216
100 = 100

This means that the equation is satisfied with the given sum of the two numbers. However, we need to find the values of x and y. Since we have two equations, we can solve for x and y.

From the first equation, we have:

16x^4 + y^4 = 1216

Let's divide both sides by 16 to simplify the equation:

x^4 + (y^4 / 16) = 76

Now, let's square the second equation:

(x + y)^2 = 10^2
x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 100

Substitute the value of x + y from the first equation into the second equation:

x^2 + 2(10) + y^2 = 100
x^2 + 20 + y^2 = 100

Now, let's substitute the value of y^2 from the first equation into the second equation:

x^2 + 20 + (76 - x^4) = 100
x^2 + 20 + 76 - x^4 = 100

Now, let's combine like terms:

x^2 + 96 - x^4 = 100

This is a quadratic equation in x^2, which we can solve for x^2:

x^2 + 96 = 100

917,The sum of 38 and twice a number raised to the power of 3 is equal to 1250. Find the number.,"Let's denote the unknown number as x. According to the problem, we have the following equation:

38 + 2x^3 = 1250

First, we need to isolate the term with x on one side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 38 from both sides:

2x^3 = 1250 - 38
2x^3 = 1212

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for x^3:

x^3 = 1212 / 2
x^3 = 606

Now, we take the cube root of both sides to solve for x:

x = ³√606

Using a calculator, we find that the cube root of 606 is approximately:

x ≈ 8.453

Therefore, the number we are looking for is approximately 8.453.","We are asked to find the solution to the equation: 38 + 2x^3 = 1250. 

To solve this, we must isolate the term with the power:

1250 - 38 = 2x^3
1212 = 2x^3

We can rearrange this term by taking the cube root of both sides:

2x^1 = 14.639 approximately

We can conclude that x = 2, which is our final answer.

918,"Three times a number is the same as the difference of twice the square of the number and seven. Additionally, half the cube of the number is equal to the original number multiplied by four. Find the number.","Let's denote the number we are looking for as \( x \).

According to the first statement, ""Three times a number is the same as the difference of twice the square of the number and seven,"" we can write the following equation:

\[ 3x = 2x^2 - 7 \]

According to the second statement, ""Half the cube of the number is equal to the original number multiplied by four,"" we can write the following equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x^3 = 4x \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) \( 3x = 2x^2 - 7 \)
2) \( \frac{1}{2}x^3 = 4x \)

Let's solve the second equation first:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x^3 = 4x \]
\[ x^3 = 8x \]
\[ x^3 - 8x = 0 \]
\[ x(x^2 - 8) = 0 \]

This gives us two solutions for \( x \):

a) \( x = 0 \)
b) \( x^2 - 8 = 0 \) which gives \( x = \sqrt{8} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{8} \)

Now let's check which of these solutions also satisfies the first equation:

For \( x = 0 \):
\[ 3(0) = 2(0)^2 - 7 \]
\[ 0 = 0 - 7 \]
\[ 0 \neq -7 \]
So, \( x = 0 \) is not a solution.

For \( x = \sqrt{8} \):
\[ 3\sqrt{8} = 2(\sqrt{8})^2 - 7 \]
\[ 3\sqrt{8} = 2(8) - 7 \]
\[ 3\sqrt{8} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ 3\sqrt{8} = 9 \]
\[ \sqrt{8} = 3 \]
This is not true, so \( x = \sqrt{8} \) is not a solution.

For \( x = -\sqrt{8} \):
\[ 3(-\sqrt{8}) = 2(-\sqrt{8})^2 - 7 \]
\[ -3\sqrt{8} = 2(8) - 7 \]
\[ -3\sqrt{8} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ -3\sqrt{8} = 9 \]
\[ -\sqrt{8} = -3 \]
This is true, so \( x = -\sqrt{8} \) is a solution.

Therefore, the number we are looking for is \( x = -\sqrt{8} \), which can also be written as \( x = -2\sqrt{2} \).","We have two equations:
1. $3x = 2x^2 - 7$.
2. $\frac{1}{2}x^3 = 4x$. 

Solving for $x$ in the first equation: $x^2 - 7/3 = x/3$. Square both sides: $x^4 - 14x^2/9 + x^2/9 = x^2/9$. This simplifies to $x^4 - 14x^2/9 = x^2/9$. Add $15x^2/9$ to both sides: $x^4 + x^2/9 = 23x^2/9$. 

Now, note that $x^4 + x^2 = x^2(x^2 + 1)$. So we have $x^2(x^2 + 1) = 23x^2/9$, which implies $x^2 + 1 = 23/9$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = \pm\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}$.

919,"The state market has 27 more apples than oranges and 11 more oranges than bananas. There are 301 apples, oranges, and bananas all together. How many apples are in the market?","Let's denote the number of apples as A, the number of oranges as O, and the number of bananas as B.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. A = O + 27 (since there are 27 more apples than oranges)
2. O = B + 11 (since there are 11 more oranges than bananas)
3. A + O + B = 301 (since there are 301 apples, oranges, and bananas all together)

We can substitute the first two equations into the third to find the number of each fruit.

From equation 2, we can express O in terms of B:
O = B + 11

Now, we can substitute O from equation 1 with B + 11:
A = (B + 11) + 27
A = B + 38

Now we have expressions for A and O in terms of B. We can substitute these into equation 3:

(B + 38) + (B + 11) + B = 301

Combine like terms:
3B + 49 = 301

Subtract 49 from both sides:
3B = 301 - 49
3B = 252

Divide both sides by 3 to find B:
B = 252 / 3
B = 84

Now that we have the number of bananas, we can find the number of oranges using equation 2:
O = B + 11
O = 84 + 11
O = 95

Finally, we can find the number of apples using equation 1:
A = O + 27
A = 95 + 27
A = 122

So, there are 122 apples in the market.","Let's denote apples as A, oranges as O, and bananas as B. We have:

A = O + 27
O = B + 11
A + O + B = 301

Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
A = (B + 11) + 27

Now substituting this expression of A into the third equation yields:
(B + 11) + 27 + B = 301
2B + 38 = 301
2B = 263
B = 131.5

Plugging this back into O = B + 11 yields:
O = 142.5

And finally, A = O + 27 gives us:
A = 169.5

The final result is: 170 apples.","Let's denote the number of apples as A, the number of oranges as O, and the number of bananas as B.

According to the information given, we have the following equations:

1) A = O + 27
2) O = B + 11
3) A + O + B = 301

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the first equation:

A = (B + 11) + 27

Now, let's substitute the third equation into the second equation:

O = (A + B) + 11

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the third equation:

A + O + B = A + (A + B) + 11 + B

Now, let's simplify the third equation:

A + O + B = A + A + B + B + 11

Combine like terms:

A + O + B = 2A + 2B + 11

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the third equation:

A + O + B = (O + 27) + B + 11

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the third equation:

A + O + B = (B + 11) + B + 11

Now, let's simplify the third equation:

A + O + B = 2B + 22

Now, let's solve for A:

A = 2B + 22 - O

We know that A + O + B = 301, so we can substitute this into the equation for A:

A = 2B + 22 - (301 - A)

Now, let's solve for A:

A = 2B + 22 - 301 + A

Combine like terms:

A = A + 2B + 22 - 301

Now, let's move the term with A to the other side of the equation:

A - A = 2B + 22 - 301

The term with A cancels out:

0 = 2B + 22 - 301

Now, let's solve for B:

2B = 301 - 22
2B = 279
B = 279 / 2
B = 139.5

Since the number of bananas must be a whole number, we can round B to the nearest whole number. Since 139.5 is closer to 140 than to 139, we'll round B to",170,139,122

The price of the refrigerator is twice the price of the washer. The price of the microwave is half the price of the dryer. What are the costs of each appliance?","Let's denote the cost of the dryer as D. According to the problem, the cost of the washer is 3 times the cost of the dryer, so the washer costs 3D. The refrigerator costs twice the washer, so it costs 2 * 3D = 6D. The microwave costs half the dryer, so it costs D/2.

Now, we can write an equation for the total cost of all the appliances:

D (dryer) + 3D (washer) + 6D (refrigerator) + D/2 (microwave) = $2,000

Combining like terms, we get:

D + 3D + 6D + D/2 = $2,000
10.5D = $2,000

Now, we solve for D:

D = $2,000 / 10.5
D = $190.48 (approximately)

Now that we have the cost of the dryer, we can find the cost of the other appliances:

- Washer: 3D = 3 * $190.48 ≈ $571.43
- Refrigerator: 6D = 6 * $190.48 ≈ $1,142.86
- Microwave: D/2 = $190.48 / 2 ≈ $95.24

So, the approximate costs of each appliance are:

- Dryer: $190.48
- Washer: $571.43
- Refrigerator: $1,142.86
- Microwave: $95.24

Note that due to rounding, the total might not be exactly $2,000, but it should be very close.","1. We know that the cost of the washer is 3 times the cost of the dryer: dryer cost = 1/3 * washer cost.

2. The refrigerator's price is twice that of the washer: refrigerator cost = 2 * washer cost.

3. The microwave's price is half that of the dryer: microwave cost = 1/2 * dryer cost = 1/6 * washer cost.

4. Adding these equations yields: 
washer cost + dryer cost + refrigerator cost + microwave cost = $2000
5. We can solve this equation for the cost of the washer. The result is:
washer cost = $500

6. We can now find the costs of the other appliances: 
dryer cost = $166.67 
refrigerator cost = $1000 
microwave cost = $83.33

$166.67 + $83.33 = $250 for dryer and microwave.

$1000","Let's denote the price of the dryer as D. According to the information given, the price of the washer is 3 times the price of the dryer, so the price of the washer is 3D. The price of the refrigerator is twice the price of the washer, so the price of the refrigerator is 2(3D) = 6D. The price of the microwave is half the price of the dryer, so the price of the microwave is D/2.

Now, we know that the combined cost of all the appliances is $2,000. We can set up the following equation to represent this:

3D + 6D + D/2 + D = $2,000

To combine like terms, we first add the prices of the washer and the refrigerator:

3D + 6D = 9D

Now, we add the price of the dryer to the total:

9D + D = 10D

Next, we add the price of the microwave to the total:

10D + D/2 = 10D + 0.5D = 10.5D

Now we have the total cost of all the appliances:

10.5D = $2,000

To find the price of the dryer, we divide the total cost by the number of appliances:

D = $2,000 / 10.5

D = $190.48

Now that we have the price of the dryer, we can find the price of the washer by multiplying the price of the dryer by 3:

Price of the washer = 3D = 3($190.48) = $571.44

The price of the refrigerator is twice the price of the washer, so:

Price of the refrigerator = 2($571.44) = $1,142.88

The price of the microwave is half the price of the dryer, so:

Price of the microwave = D/2 = $190.48 / 2 = $95.24

Now we have the prices of all the appliances:

- Price of the dryer = $190.48
- Price of the washer = $571.44
- Price of the refrigerator = $1,142.88
- Price of the microwave = $95.24

3/4 * x + 3^2 = 1/5 * (x - 8 * x^(1/3))

Now, let's solve for x.

First, simplify the equation:

3/4 * x + 9 = 1/5 * (x - 8 * x^(1/3))

Multiply both sides by 20 to clear the fractions:

20 * (3/4 * x + 9) = 20 * (1/5 * (x - 8 * x^(1/3)))

15x + 180 = 4x - 32 * x^(1/3)

Now, let's move all terms involving x to one side of the equation:

15x - 4x = -180 - 32 * x^(1/3)

11x = -180 - 32 * x^(1/3)

To solve this equation, we can use substitution. Let y = x^(1/3), so x = y^3. The equation becomes:

11y^3 = -180 - 32y

Now we have a cubic equation in terms of y:

11y^3 + 32y + 180 = 0

This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically can be quite complex. However, we can try to find a rational root by using the Rational Root Theorem or by trial and error.

Let's try some possible rational roots, which are the factors of 180 divided by the factors of 11. The factors of 180 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6, ±9, ±10, ±12, ±15, ±18, ±20, ±30, ±36, ±45, ±60, ±90, ±180, and the factors of 11 are ±1, ±11.

We can try these values for y and see if any of them satisfy the equation. After trying a few values, we find that y = -3 is a root because:

11(-3)^3 + 32(-3) + 180 = -297 - 96 + 180 = 0

3/4 of x + 3^2 = 1/5 of (x - 8 * x^(1/3))
3/4 of x + 9 = 1/5 of (x - 8 * x^(1/3))
3/4 of x = 1/5 of (x - 8 * x^(1/3)) - 9

City Rentals rents a basic car at a daily cost of 18.95 dollars plus 0.16 per mile, and they waive their 2% service tax for rentals exceeding 100 miles. For a 5-day rental, at what mileage is the cost the same for both companies?","Let's calculate the cost for both companies for a 5-day rental and then find the mileage at which the cost is the same.

For Sunshine Car Rentals:
The daily rate is $17.99, but there is a 10% discount for rentals longer than 3 days. So the discounted daily rate is:
$17.99 - ($17.99 * 10%) = $17.99 - $1.799 = $16.191 per day

For a 5-day rental, the cost without mileage would be:
$16.191 * 5 days = $80.955

The cost per mile is $0.18, so the total cost for Sunshine Car Rentals for a 5-day rental and x miles would be:
Total cost = $80.955 + ($0.18 * x)

For City Rentals:
The daily rate is $18.95, and there is no discount on the daily rate regardless of the rental duration. So for a 5-day rental, the cost without mileage would be:
$18.95 * 5 days = $94.75

City Rentals waives the 2% service tax for rentals exceeding 100 miles, but since we are not given the amount of the service tax, we will assume it is already included in the daily rate or is negligible for this comparison.

The cost per mile is $0.16, so the total cost for City Rentals for a 5-day rental and x miles would be:
Total cost = $94.75 + ($0.16 * x)

Now, we set the total costs equal to each other to find the mileage at which the cost is the same:

$80.955 + ($0.18 * x) = $94.75 + ($0.16 * x)

To solve for x, we first subtract $80.955 from both sides:

$0.18 * x = $94.75 - $80.955 + ($0.16 * x)
$0.18 * x = $13.795 + ($0.16 * x)

Now, we subtract $0.16 * x from both sides to get the x terms on one side:

$0.18 * x - $0.16 * x = $13.795
$0.02 * x = $13.795

Finally, we divide both sides by $0.02 to solve for x:

x = $13.795 / $0.02
x = 689.75

So, at 689.75 miles, the cost of renting a basic car for 5 days would be the same for both Sunshine Car Rentals and City Rentals.","To determine the mileage at which the costs of both companies become equal, we first calculate the total cost for each company as follows:

Sunshine Car Rentals:
Daily rate: $17.99 x 5 = $89.95
Per mile rate: $0.18 x 100 miles = $18
Total cost: $107.95

City Rentals:
Daily rate: $18.95 x 5 = $94.75
Per mile rate: $0.16 x 100 miles = $16
Total cost: $110.75

Since City Rentals' total cost is higher, we can determine that the cost for both companies will equal each other at some point below 100 miles.

Let's x represent the number of miles at which the costs equal each other:
$17.99 x 5 + $0.18 x x = $18.95 x 5 + $0.16 x x
89.95 + 0.18x = 94.75 + 0.16x
35 cents worth of miles, approximately 16 miles

Therefore, the result is **16**.","Let's calculate the cost for each company at different mileage levels to find the mileage where the cost is the same for both companies.

For Sunshine Car Rentals:
The daily rate is $17.99, and the per-mile rate is $0.18.

For City Rentals:
The daily rate is $18.95, and the per-mile rate is $0.16.

First, let's calculate the cost for each company at different mileage levels:

Sunshine Car Rentals:
Cost = Daily rate + (Per mile rate * Miles)
Cost = $17.99 + ($0.18 * Miles)

City Rentals:
Cost = Daily rate + (Per mile rate * Miles)
Cost = $18.95 + ($0.16 * Miles)

Now, let's find the mileage where the cost is the same for both companies:

Sunshine Car Rentals:
Cost = $17.99 + ($0.18 * Miles)

City Rentals:
Cost = $18.95 + ($0.16 * Miles)

To find the mileage where the cost is the same, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

$17.99 + ($0.18 * Miles) = $18.95 + ($0.16 * Miles)

Now, let's solve for Miles:

$17.99 + $0.18 * Miles = $18.95 + $0.16 * Miles

Subtract $17.99 from both sides:

$0.18 * Miles = $18.95 - $17.99

$0.18 * Miles = $1.06

Now, divide both sides by $0.18 to solve for Miles:

Miles = ($1.06 / $0.18)

Miles = 6

So, at 6 miles, the cost is the same for both companies.",16,6,689.75
923,"In 2010, let's assume that the world grain supply S (in metric tons) is influenced by the fluctuations in production F (measured as a percentage) and changes in population growth P (measured as a percentage of the global population). The given information shows that the supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand D.

Additionally, the supply is dependent on the production fluctuations F, such that S = S0 * (1 + F), where S0 is the base supply value (1,800,000 metric tons) under normal production conditions.

Similarly, the demand is dependent on the population growth P, such that D = D0 * (1 + P), where D0 is the initial demand value under normal population growth.

The problem then requires solving the following system of equations:

1. S = 0.75 * D
2. S = S0 * (1 + F)
3. D = D0 * (1 + P)

Given the base supply value S0 (1,800,000 metric tons) and the relationships between supply, demand, production fluctuations, and population growth outlined in the system of equations, determine the world grain demand D in 2010.","To determine the world grain demand D in 2010, we need to use the given system of equations. We have the following:

1. \( S = 0.75 \times D \)
2. \( S = S_0 \times (1 + F) \)
3. \( D = D_0 \times (1 + P) \)

We are given that \( S_0 = 1,800,000 \) metric tons, but we do not have the values for \( F \) and \( P \). However, we can still express \( D \) in terms of \( S_0 \), \( F \), and \( P \) using the equations above.

From equation 1, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( S \):

\( D = \frac{S}{0.75} \)

Now, using equation 2, we can substitute \( S \) with \( S_0 \times (1 + F) \):

\( D = \frac{S_0 \times (1 + F)}{0.75} \)

Since we are given \( S_0 \), we can plug that value into the equation:

\( D = \frac{1,800,000 \times (1 + F)}{0.75} \)

Without the value of \( F \), we cannot calculate a numerical value for \( D \). We need the production fluctuation percentage \( F \) to find the exact demand \( D \). If \( F \) were provided, we could solve for \( D \) using the equation above.","1. We first solve equation 3, rearranging to solve for D0:
D0 = D / (1 + P)

2. Equation 2 can then be rewritten in terms of S0 and F using the given relationship:
S = 1,800,000 * F

3. Substituting the expression for S from equation 1 into this new equation yields:
1,800,000 * F = 0.75 * D

4. We can solve this equation for D by dividing both sides by 0.75:
D = 2,400,000 * F

5. Finally, substituting this back into the expression for D0 gives:
D0 = 2,400,000 * (1 + P) * F

The world grain demand D in 2010 was 2,400,000 metric tons.","Let's denote the initial demand value D0 as D0 = 1. This means that under normal population growth, the demand is 1 metric ton.

From the given information, we know that the supply is 0.75 of the demand, so we can write:

S = 0.75 * D

We are also given that the supply is dependent on the production fluctuations F, such that:

S = S0 * (1 + F)

We are given that S0 = 1,800,000 metric tons, so we can rewrite the equation as:

S = 1,800,000 * (1 + F)

Now, we have two equations:

1. S = 0.75 * D
2. S = 1,800,000 * (1 + F)

We can solve for D by substituting the expression for S from the second equation into the first equation:

0.75 * D = 1,800,000 * (1 + F)

Now, we can solve for D:

D = (1,800,000 * (1 + F)) / 0.75

Since we are not given the values of F or P, we cannot determine the exact value of D. However, we can express D in terms of F and P:

D = (1,800,000 * (1 + F)) / 0.75 = 2,400,000 * (1 + F) / 0.75

This means that the world grain demand D is dependent on the production fluctuations F and the population growth P. Without the specific values of F and P, we cannot determine the exact value of D.","2,400,000","2,400,000 * (1 + F) / 0.75",D.
924,Find the number whose triple is 45 greater than the square of its half.,"Let's call the number we're looking for x.

According to the problem, the triple of this number (3x) is 45 greater than the square of its half (x/2)^2. So we can set up the following equation:

3x = (x/2)^2 + 45

Now let's solve for x:

First, expand the square on the right side of the equation:

3x = (x^2/4) + 45

To solve for x, we need to get all terms involving x on one side of the equation and the constant on the other side. Multiply through by 4 to get rid of the fraction:

12x = x^2 + 180

Now we have a quadratic equation. Let's move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:

x^2 - 12x + 180 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in standard form. We can solve for x by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let's try to factor it first:

(x - 10)(x - 18) = 0

So the two possible solutions for x are:

x = 10 or x = 18

We need to check which of these solutions fits the original problem. Let's check both:

For x = 10:
3x = 3(10) = 30
(x/2)^2 = (10/2)^2 = 5^2 = 25
25 + 45 = 70, which is not equal to 30, so x = 10 is not the correct solution.

For x = 18:
3x = 3(18) = 54
(x/2)^2 = (18/2)^2 = 9^2 = 81
81 + 45 = 126, which is equal to 54, so x = 18 is the correct solution.

Therefore, the number we're looking for is 18.","Let's solve the math problem you provided. 

We need to find the number whose triple is 45 greater than the square of its half. We can break this down into steps:
1. Find the square of the half of the unknown number: x / 2 ^ 2 = x/4
2. Add 45 to the result: x/4 + 45
3. Multiply the result by 3: (x/4 + 45) * 3

So now, we have the equation:
x/4 + 45 = 135

Continuing to solve for x:
x/4 = 90
x = 360

Therefore, the final result is 6.

Six.","Let's denote the number we are looking for as x. According to the problem, the triple of this number is 45 greater than the square of its half. We can write this relationship as an equation:

x * 3 = (x / 2)^2 + 45

Now, let's solve for x:

1. First, let's square the half of x:
   (x / 2)^2 = (x / 2) * (x / 2) = (x * x) / 4 = x^2 / 4

2. Now, let's add 45 to the square of the half of x:
   x^2 / 4 + 45 = (x^2 + 45 * 4) / 4 = (x^2 + 180) / 4

3. Now, let's multiply the triple of x by 3:
   x * 3 = 3x

4. Now, let's set the two expressions equal to each other:
   3x = (x^2 + 180) / 4

5. To solve for x, we need to get all terms involving x on one side of the equation. First, let's multiply the entire equation by 4 to get rid of the denominator:
   12x = x^2 + 180

6. Now, let's subtract x^2 from both sides to get the x^2 terms on one side:
   12x - x^2 = 180

7. Factor out the x^2 term:
   (x^2 - 12x) = 180

8. Now, let's factor the quadratic term:
   (x^2 - 12x + 9x^2) = 180
   (11x^2 - 12x) = 180

9. The quadratic term can be factored as follows:
   (11x^2 - 12x) = (11x - 4)(x + 3)

10. Now, let's set the quadratic term equal to 180 and solve for x:
   11x - 4 = 180
   11x = 180 + 4
   11x = 184
    x = 184 / 11
    x = 16.72727273 (approximately)

The total original cost of the 3 muffins and the bottle of juice is \( 3M + 1.45 \) dollars.

A 15% discount was applied to this total cost, so Kevin paid 85% of the original price. The total amount Kevin paid after the discount is \( 0.85 \times (3M + 1.45) \) dollars.

We know that Kevin paid a total of 3.70 dollars after the discount, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.85 \times (3M + 1.45) = 3.70 \]

Now, let's solve for \( M \):

\[ 3M + 1.45 = \frac{3.70}{0.85} \]

\[ 3M + 1.45 = 4.35294117647 \] (rounded to 11 decimal places for accuracy)

\[ 3M = 4.35294117647 - 1.45 \]

\[ 3M = 2.90294117647 \]

\[ M = \frac{2.90294117647}{3} \]

\[ M = 0.96764705882 \] (rounded to 11 decimal places for accuracy)

So, the original cost of each muffin was approximately 0.97 dollars.","Kevin's purchase including the bottle of juice originally cost 1.45 x 4 = 5.80 dollars. After the 15% discount, the remaining cost is 5.80 x 85% = 4.93 dollars. The three muffins originally cost 4.93 - 1.45 = 3.48 dollars.

Therefore the original cost of each muffin is 3.48/3 = 1.16 dollars.

The answer is 1.16.","Let's denote the original cost of each muffin as M.

A 15% discount was applied to his purchase, so the discount amount is:
0.15 * (3M + 1.45)

After the discount, Kevin paid a total of 3.70 dollars. So, the total cost after the discount is:

3M + 1.45 - 0.15 * (3M + 1.45) = 3.70
3M + 1.45 - 0.45M - 0.2125 = 3.70
3M - 0.2125M = 3.70 - 1.45
3M - 0.2125M = 2.25

The total estimated cost of materials is 720 dollars, which include a 5% sales tax. How many hours will the job take for the carpenter and his assistant to complete together?","First, let's find out the total labor cost by subtracting the cost of materials from the total estimate:

Total estimate = $1500
Cost of materials (including tax) = $720

Total labor cost = Total estimate - Cost of materials
Total labor cost = $1500 - $720
Total labor cost = $780

Now, let's find out the combined hourly rate of the carpenter and his assistant:

Carpenter's hourly rate = $35/hour
Assistant's hourly rate = $25/hour

Combined hourly rate = Carpenter's hourly rate + Assistant's hourly rate
Combined hourly rate = $35/hour + $25/hour
Combined hourly rate = $60/hour

Now, we can calculate the total number of hours they will work together by dividing the total labor cost by the combined hourly rate:

Total labor cost = $780
Combined hourly rate = $60/hour

Total hours = Total labor cost / Combined hourly rate
Total hours = $780 / $60/hour
Total hours = 13 hours

So, the job will take the carpenter and his assistant a total of 13 hours to complete together.","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of labor and then divide the total cost by the combined hourly rate. Here are the steps:

1. Calculate the total labor cost: 35 USD/hr (carpenter) + 25 USD/hr (assistant) = 60 USD/hr

2. Divide the total estimated cost by the hourly rate: 1500 USD / 60 USD/hr = 25 hours

The carpenter and his assistant will take 25 hours to complete the job.

25 hours.","First, let's calculate the total cost of materials including the sales tax:

Total cost of materials = 720 dollars + (5% of 720 dollars)
Total cost of materials = 720 dollars + (0.05 * 720 dollars)
Total cost of materials = 720 dollars + 36 dollars
Total cost of materials = 756 dollars

Now, let's calculate the total estimated cost for the job:

Total estimated cost = Cost of materials + Carpenter's labor + Assistant's labor
Total estimated cost = 756 dollars + (35 dollars/hour * Carpenter's hours) + (25 dollars/hour * Assistant's hours)

We don't have the number of hours the job will take, so we can't calculate the total estimated cost yet. However, we can express the total estimated cost as a function of the number of hours:

Total estimated cost = 756 dollars + (35 dollars/hour * Carpenter's hours) + (25 dollars/hour * Assistant's hours)

Now, let's find out how many hours the carpenter and his assistant will work together:

Total hours = Carpenter's hours + Assistant's hours

Since we don't have the number of hours, we can't calculate the total hours yet. However, we can express the total hours as a function of the number of hours:

Total hours = Carpenter's hours + Assistant's hours

Now, let's find out how many hours the carpenter and his assistant will work together to complete the job:

Total hours = Carpenter's hours + Assistant's hours
Total hours = (Total estimated cost - Cost of materials) / (Carpenter's hourly rate + Assistant's hourly rate)

Since we don't have the number of hours, we can't calculate the total hours yet. However, we can express the total hours as a function of the number of hours:

Total hours = (Total estimated cost - Cost of materials) / (Carpenter's hourly rate + Assistant's hourly rate)

In summary, we can't calculate the exact number of hours the job will take without knowing the number of hours.

It is given that T is 77.75 inches tall and is 9.5 inches taller than S. Also, P is 5 inches taller than S, and Q is 3 inches shorter than P. We need to find the height of the shortest player (S) in inches, using the given information and algebraic equations.

1) T = 77.75
2) T = S + 9.5
3) P = S + 5
4) Q = P - 3","To find the height of the shortest player (S), we can use the given equations. We know that T is 9.5 inches taller than S, so we can set up the equation:

T = S + 9.5

We also know that T is 77.75 inches tall, so we can substitute T with 77.75 in the equation:

77.75 = S + 9.5

Now, we can solve for S by subtracting 9.5 from both sides of the equation:

77.75 - 9.5 = S
68.25 = S

Therefore, the height of the shortest player (S) is 68.25 inches.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1, we get S = 68.25 inches.

2. Alternatively, we can also substitute equation 4 into equation 3 to get P = Q + 3, or 
Q = P - 3, which means that P and Q are 3 inches apart. 

Since T = 77.75 is known, we can work out P first by subtracting 9.5 from 77.75, giving us P = 68.25. We know that P and Q are 3 inches apart, so Q must be 65.25 inches tall, and with S = P - 5, we get 63.25 inches as the height of the shortest player. 

The height of the shortest player (S) is 63.25 inches.","Let's denote the height of the shortest player as S.

According to the given information:
1) T = 77.75 inches tall
2) T = S + 9.5 inches

From equation 2, we can express T in terms of S:
T = S + 9.5

Now, let's substitute this expression for T into equation 3:
P = (S + 9.5) + 5

To simplify the equation, we can combine like terms:
P = S + 14.5

S = P - 14.5

S = (S + 5) - 14.5

To simplify the equation, we can combine like terms:
S = S + 5 - 14.5

If there were 3 senior citizens present and a group of 15 purchased tickets together, how many children attended the play?","Let's denote the number of adult tickets sold as A and the number of child tickets sold as C. We know that the total number of people is 80, so we can write the equation:

A + C = 80  (1)

We also know that the total amount collected from ticket sales is $840. The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $6, so we can write the equation:

12A + 6C = 840  (2)

Now, let's consider the discounts. We have 3 senior citizens who would get a 25% discount on the adult ticket price. The discounted price for a senior citizen ticket would be $12 - 0.25 * $12 = $12 - $3 = $9.

For the group of 15, we don't know the composition of adults and children, but they would also get a 25% discount on their tickets. However, we don't need to calculate the exact discount for the group because we are looking for the number of children, and the total amount collected is already given as $840.

Let's solve the system of equations (1) and (2). We can multiply equation (1) by 6 to make the coefficients of C the same in both equations:

6A + 6C = 480  (3)

Now, subtract equation (3) from equation (2):

(12A + 6C) - (6A + 6C) = 840 - 480
6A = 360
A = 360 / 6
A = 60

Now that we know there were 60 adult tickets sold, we can find the number of child tickets by substituting A back into equation (1):

60 + C = 80
C = 80 - 60

The theater collected $840 from ticket sales. We know that adult tickets cost $12 each, so the number of adult tickets sold is:
$840 / $12 = 70 adult tickets

We are told that there were 3 senior citizens present, so the number of adult tickets sold to senior citizens is:
3 senior citizens * $12 = $36

Now, we subtract the amount collected from senior citizens from the total amount collected to find the amount collected from adult tickets:
$840 - $36 = $804

We know that the theater offered a 25% discount for senior citizens and group purchases of 10 or more people. Since we have a group of 15, we can calculate the discount for this group:
25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3

Now, we subtract the discount for the group from the amount collected from adult tickets:
$804 - $3 = $801

We know that the group of 15 purchased tickets together, so the number of adult tickets sold to the group is:
15 group members * $12 = $180

Now, we subtract the amount collected from the group from the total amount collected from adult tickets:
$801 - $180 = $621

The remaining amount collected from adult tickets is $621. Since we have 70 adult tickets sold, we can calculate the average price per adult ticket:
$621 / 70 = $9 per adult ticket

Now, we know that the adult tickets cost $12 each, so the difference between the average price per adult ticket and the actual price per adult ticket is the discount given to the group:
$12 - $9 = $3

This $3 is the discount given to the group for each of their tickets. Since there are 15 tickets in the group, the total discount for the group is:
$3 * 15 = $45

Now, we subtract the total discount for the group from the total amount collected to find the amount collected from children:
$840 - $45 = $795

We know that child tickets cost $6 each, so the number of child tickets sold is:
$795 / $6 = 132.5 child tickets

Since we can't have a fraction of a ticket, we need to check if the number of children is a whole number. If it's not, it means there was a mistake in the calculations.

Now, we can find the cost of the garden table, which is 2 times the cost of the bench:

Garden Table = 2B
Garden Table = 2 * 127.5
Garden Table = 255 dollars

And the cost of the garden umbrella, which is 3 times the cost of the bench:

Garden Umbrella = 3B
Garden Umbrella = 3 * 127.5
Garden Umbrella = 382.5 dollars

In summary:
- The bench costs 127.5 dollars.
- The garden table costs 255 dollars.
- The garden umbrella costs 382.5 dollars.","We know that the cost of the table is 2 times the cost of the bench and the umbrella costs 3 times the bench. We also know that the total cost of all three items is $765. 

We can therefore conclude that the cost of the bench is $105, the table is $210, and the umbrella is $315. 

$315.","Let's denote the price of the bench as B. According to the problem, the price of the garden table is 2 times the price of the bench, so the price of the garden table is 2B. The price of the garden umbrella is 3 times the price of the bench, so the price of the garden umbrella is 3B.

The total cost of the bench, garden table, and garden umbrella together is 765 dollars. We can write this as an equation:

2B + 3B + B = 765

Now, let's combine like terms:

6B + B = 765

Combine the terms:

7B = 765

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for B:

B = 765 / 7

B = 109.29 (approximately)

Since the price of the bench cannot be a fraction of a dollar, we can round B to the nearest whole dollar. Since 109.29 is closer to 109 than 110, we can round B to 109 dollars.

Now that we have the price of the bench, we can find the prices of the garden table and the garden umbrella using the relationships given in the problem:

The price of the garden table is 2 times the price of the bench, so:

Price of garden table = 2B = 2 * 109 = 218 dollars

The price of the garden umbrella is 3 times the price of the bench, so:

Price of garden umbrella = 3B = 3 * 109 = 327 dollars

Therefore, the costs of the bench, the garden table, and the garden umbrella are:

- Bench: 109 dollars
- Garden table: 218 dollars
- Garden umbrella: 327 dollars",315,109,382.5
931,"A plane is using fuel at the rate of F gallons per hour, and it has R gallons left in its tank. The plane is flying against a crosswind with a speed of C miles per hour, which increases the fuel consumption rate by an additional G gallons per hour per mile crosswind speed. Define the available flying time (T) in hours as the remaining fuel divided by the effective fuel consumption rate. Calculate T in terms of F, R, C, and G.","The effective fuel consumption rate is the normal fuel consumption rate (F gallons per hour) plus the additional fuel consumption due to the crosswind. The additional fuel consumption is G gallons per hour for each mile per hour of crosswind speed (C mph). Therefore, the additional fuel consumption due to the crosswind is G * C gallons per hour.

The total effective fuel consumption rate is then:
F + G * C

The available flying time (T) is the remaining fuel (R gallons) divided by the effective fuel consumption rate. Therefore, we can express T as:

T = R / (F + G * C)

This is the formula for the available flying time in terms of F, R, C, and G.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We are given the following variables: 
   - F = fuel consumption rate (gallons per hour)
   - R = remaining fuel (gallons)
   - C = crosswind speed (miles per hour)
   - G = additional fuel consumption rate per mile crosswind speed (gallons per hour per mile)

2. We need to determine the effective fuel consumption rate, which is the sum of the base rate F and the rate increase due to the crosswind: 
   - Effective rate = F + (C * G) gallons per hour

3. Now we can find the available flying time: 
   - T = R / (F + C * G) hours

4. Finally, we can calculate the value of T:
   - T = (R / F) - C * (R / F) / G

5. The result is: 
   - T = (R / (F * G)) - C * (1 / G)

So the final answer is:

(R / (F * G)) - C

Or, if G = 1:

(R / (F C)) - C

And if all the values are known, this formula can be used to calculate T.","Let's denote the effective fuel consumption rate as E. This rate is the sum of the normal fuel consumption rate (F) and the additional fuel consumption due to the crosswind (G * C). So we have:

E = F + G * C

The available flying time (T) is given by the remaining fuel (R) divided by the effective fuel consumption rate (E):

T = R / E

Substituting the expression for E into the equation for T, we get:

T = R / (F + G * C)

Now we have an equation for T in terms of F, R, C, and G.",T,T.,T

933,"The probability that San Francisco plays in the next super bowl is nine times the probability that they do not play in the next super bowl. The probability that New York plays in the next super bowl is five times the probability that they do not play in the next super bowl. Given that the probability of San Francisco, New York, or another team playing in the next super bowl is 1, what are the probabilities that San Francisco or New York play in the next super bowl, respectively?","Let's denote the probability that San Francisco plays in the next Super Bowl as P(SF) and the probability that they do not play as P(not SF). Similarly, let's denote the probability that New York plays in the next Super Bowl as P(NY) and the probability that they do not play as P(not NY).

According to the problem, we have:

P(SF) = 9 * P(not SF)  [1]
P(NY) = 5 * P(not NY)  [2]

We also know that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal 1, so:

P(SF) + P(not SF) + P(NY) + P(not NY) = 1  [3]

Using equations [1] and [2], we can express P(not SF) and P(not NY) in terms of P(SF) and P(NY):

P(not SF) = P(SF) / 9  [4]
P(not NY) = P(NY) / 5  [5]

Substituting [4] and [5] into [3], we get:

P(SF) + (P(SF) / 9) + P(NY) + (P(NY) / 5) = 1

Multiplying through by 45 (the least common multiple of 9 and 5) to clear the denominators, we get:

45 * P(SF) + 5 * P(SF) + 45 * P(NY) + 9 * P(NY) = 45

Combining like terms, we get:

50 * P(SF) + 54 * P(NY) = 45

Now, we can express P(NY) in terms of P(SF):

54 * P(NY) = 45 - 50 * P(SF)
P(NY) = (45 - 50 * P(SF)) / 54

Since P(SF) and P(NY) are probabilities, they must be between 0 and 1. We can find the value of P(SF) that satisfies this condition and then calculate P(NY) accordingly.

From equation [1], we can express P(SF) as:

P(SF) = 9 * P(not SF)
P(SF) + P(not SF) = 1
P(SF) + (P(SF) / 9) = 1
(10/9) * P(SF) = 1
P(SF) = 9/10

Now we can find P(NY) using the expression we derived:

P(NY) = (45 - 50 * (9/10)) / 54
P(NY) = (45 - 45) / 54
P(NY) = 0 / 54
P(NY) = 0

So, the probability that San Francisco plays in the next Super Bowl is 9/10, and the probability that New York plays in the next Super Bowl is 0.","We are asked to find the probabilities that San Francisco or New York play in the next Super Bowl given certain multiplicity relationships between the probabilities of their success and failure. 

We have the equations:
- SF success probability = 9 * SF failure probability
- NY success probability = 5 * NY failure probability

And we are also given that:
- SF or NY (or another team) will play in the Super Bowl, so (SF success probability) + (NY success probability) + probability of all other teams = 1. 

We can set up and solve for the individual probabilities as follows:

SF success probability = 9/11
NY success probability = 5/11

The final result is: 9/11
or ""nine-elevenths.""","Let's denote the probability that San Francisco plays in the next Super Bowl as P(SF). According to the information given, P(SF) is nine times the probability that they do not play, which we can denote as P(~SF). So we have:

P(SF) = 9 * P(~SF)

Similarly, let's denote the probability that New York plays in the next Super Bowl as P(NY). According to the information given, P(NY) is five times the probability that they do not play, which we can denote as P(~NY). So we have:

P(NY) = 5 * P(~NY)

Now, we are given that the probability of San Francisco, New York, or another team playing in the next Super Bowl is 1. This means that the sum of the probabilities of San Francisco playing, New York playing, and the probability of another team playing is 1. We can denote the probability of another team playing as P(Other). So we have:

P(SF) + P(NY) + P(Other) = 1

We can substitute the expressions for P(SF) and P(NY) from the first two equations into this third equation:

(9 * P(~SF)) + (5 * P(~NY)) + P(Other) = 1

Now, we need to find the probabilities of San Francisco or New York playing in the next Super Bowl. We can do this by adding the probabilities of San Francisco playing and New York playing:

P(SF or NY) = P(SF) + P(NY)

Substitute the expressions for P(SF) and P(NY) from the first two equations into this equation:

P(SF or NY) = (9 * P(~SF)) + (5 * P(~NY))

We don't have the values for P(~SF) and P(~NY), but we can express P(SF or NY) in terms of P(~SF) and P(~NY):

P(SF or NY) = 9 * P(~SF) + 5 * P(~NY)

City Rentals rents an intermediate-size car for 18.95 dollars plus 0.21 dollars per mile. Metro Car Hire rents an intermediate-size car for 25.50 dollars plus 0.17 dollars per mile, and Prestige Lease has a daily rate of 20 dollars plus 0.23 dollars per mile for an intermediate-size car. For what mileage is the cost the same for all four rental companies?","To find the mileage at which the cost is the same for all four rental companies, we need to set up equations for each company's pricing and then equate them to find the common mileage.

Let's denote the mileage as \( m \).

For Safety Rent-a-Car, the cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 21.95 + 0.19m \]

For City Rentals, the cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 18.95 + 0.21m \]

For Metro Car Hire, the cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 25.50 + 0.17m \]

For Prestige Lease, the cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 20.00 + 0.23m \]

Now, we need to find the value of \( m \) where all these costs are equal. We can do this by setting the equations equal to each other in pairs and solving for \( m \).

Let's start by equating the cost for Safety Rent-a-Car and City Rentals:
\[ 21.95 + 0.19m = 18.95 + 0.21m \]

Solving for \( m \), we get:
\[ 0.19m - 0.21m = 18.95 - 21.95 \]
\[ -0.02m = -3 \]
\[ m = \frac{-3}{-0.02} \]
\[ m = 150 \]

Now, let's equate the cost for Metro Car Hire and Prestige Lease:
\[ 25.50 + 0.17m = 20.00 + 0.23m \]

Solving for \( m \), we get:
\[ 0.17m - 0.23m = 20.00 - 25.50 \]
\[ -0.06m = -5.50 \]
\[ m = \frac{-5.50}{-0.06} \]
\[ m = 91.67 \]

Since we have two different mileages (150 and 91.67), it means that there is no single mileage at which the cost is the same for all four rental companies. To have the same cost for all four companies, all equations when set equal to each other should yield the same mileage, which is not the case here.","To solve this problem, we need to find the mileage at which the costs for all four rental companies equalize. Here are the steps to solve it:

1. Calculate the mileage cost for each rental company:

   - Safety Rent-a-Car: 21.95 dollars + 0.19 dollars/mile
   - City Rentals: 18.95 dollars + 0.21 dollars/mile
   - Metro Car Hire: 25.50 dollars + 0.17 dollars/mile
   - Prestige Lease: 20.00 dollars + 0.23 dollars/mile

2. Set the costs equal to each other and solve for the number of miles:

   21.95 + 0.19x = 18.95 + 0.21x
   25.50 + 0.17x = 20.00 + 0.23x

   - For Safety Rent-a-Car and City Rentals: Difference of 0.02 dollars/mile
   - For Metro Car Hire and Prestige Lease: Difference of 0.03 dollars/mile

3. Since we want the same cost, we set the differences equal to each other:

   0.02x = 0.03x

4. Solving for x:

   x = 15 miles

The result is: **15**","To find the mileage for which the cost is the same for all four rental companies, we need to calculate the cost per mile for each company and then set them equal to each other.

Let's calculate the cost per mile for each company:

City Rentals:
Cost per mile = 0.21 dollars per mile

Metro Car Hire:
Cost per mile = 0.17 dollars per mile

Prestige Lease:
Cost per mile = 0.23 dollars per mile

Safety Rent-a-Car = City Rentals = Metro Car Hire = Prestige Lease
0.19 dollars per mile = 0.21 dollars per mile = 0.17 dollars per mile = 0.23 dollars per mile

Each person also orders a drink that costs $3 for children and $4 for adults. At the end of the celebration, a 15% gratuity will be applied to the total bill. Calculate the total cost including gratuity for the group to celebrate at the pizza parlor.","Let's start by figuring out how many children and adults are in the group. Since there are twice as many children as adults, we can set up the following equation:

Let A be the number of adults.
Then the number of children will be 2A.

We know that the total number of people is 120, so we can write the equation as:
A + 2A = 120

Combining like terms, we get:
3A = 120

Dividing both sides by 3, we find the number of adults:
A = 120 / 3
A = 40

Since there are twice as many children as adults, the number of children is:
2A = 2 * 40 = 80

Now we can calculate the cost for the children and adults separately.

For the children:
Pizza cost: 80 children * $10/child = $800
Drink cost: 80 children * $3/child = $240
Total cost for children: $800 + $240 = $1040

For the adults:
Pizza cost: 40 adults * $12/adult = $480
Drink cost: 40 adults * $4/adult = $160
Total cost for adults: $480 + $160 = $640

Now, let's add the total cost for children and adults to get the subtotal:
Subtotal = Total cost for children + Total cost for adults
Subtotal = $1040 + $640 = $1680

Finally, we need to calculate the 15% gratuity on the subtotal:
Gratuity = 15% of $1680
Gratuity = 0.15 * $1680
Gratuity = $252

Now, let's add the gratuity to the subtotal to get the total cost:
Total cost = Subtotal + Gratuity
Total cost = $1680 + $252
Total cost = $1932

The total cost including gratuity for the group to celebrate at the pizza parlor is $1932.","There are 60 children and 30 adults in the group because 120 / 2 = 60.

The cost of the meal for the children is $600 because 60 x $10 = $600. The cost of the meal for the adults is $360 because 30 x $12 = $360. The total cost for the meals is $960 because $600 + $360 = $960.

The cost for the drinks for the children is $180 because 60 x $3 = $180. The cost for the drinks for the adults is $120 because 30 x $4 = $120. The total cost for the drinks is $300 because $180 + $120 = $300.

The total food cost is $1260 because $960 + $300 = $1260.

The gratuity is $189 because 15% x $1260 = $189.

The final cost to celebrate at the pizza parlor is $1449.

Fourteen hundred forty-nine.","Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 120 people in the whole group.
2. There are twice as many children as adults in the group.
3. The pizza parlor charges $10 per child and $12 per adult for a pizza meal.
4. Each person also orders a drink that costs $3 for children and $4 for adults.
5. At the end of the celebration, a 15% gratuity will be applied to the total bill.

First, let's find out how many children and adults there are in the group. Since there are twice as many children as adults, we can say that the number of adults is half the number of children.

Let's denote the number of children as C and the number of adults as A. According to the information given, A = C / 2.

We know that the total number of people is 120, so we can write:
C + A = 120
C + (C / 2) = 120
1.5C = 120
C = 120 / 1.5
C = 80

Now we know there are 80 children and 80 adults in the group.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for each type of person (child and adult) for the pizza meal and the drink.

For children:
Pizza meal cost = $10 per child
Drink cost = $3 per child
Total cost per child = $10 + $3 = $13

For adults:
Pizza meal cost = $12 per adult
Drink cost = $4 per adult
Total cost per adult = $12 + $4 = $16

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the group for the pizza meal and the drink, without the gratuity:

Total cost for children = 80 children * $13 per child = $1040
Total cost for adults = 80 adults * $16 per adult = $1280

Total cost for the group (without gratuity) = $1040 (for children) + $1280 (for adults) = $2320

Now, let's calculate the 15% gratuity on the total bill:

Gratuity = 15% of $2320
Gratuity = 0.15 * $2320
Gratuity = $348

Finally, let's add the gratuity to the total cost for the group:

Total cost including gratuity = $2320 (without gratuity) + $348 (gratuity) = $26",One thousand four hundred forty-nine,Twenty Six Hundred and Sixty Eight,One thousand nine hundred thirty-two

How many 5 point problems are there?","Let's denote the number of 2-point problems as x, the number of 4-point problems as y, and the number of 5-point problems as z. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of problems is 50:
x + y + z = 50

2. The total number of points for all problems is 200:
2x + 4y + 5z = 200

We have two equations with three unknowns, which means we have an underdetermined system. To find the number of 5-point problems (z), we need an additional piece of information or constraint to solve for the variables.

Without additional information, we can't determine the exact number of 5-point problems. However, we can express z in terms of x and y using the first equation:

z = 50 - x - y

Substituting this into the second equation gives us:

2x + 4y + 5(50 - x - y) = 200
2x + 4y + 250 - 5x - 5y = 200
-3x - y = 200 - 250
-3x - y = -50

Now, we can express y in terms of x:

y = -3x + 50

Since the number of problems can't be negative, x and y must be non-negative integers. We can now try different non-negative integer values for x to see if we get a corresponding non-negative integer value for y that satisfies both equations. However, without a specific constraint on the number of 2-point or 4-point problems, we can't determine the exact number of 5-point problems.","We know that all the problems put together are worth 200 points, so we can start by setting this up:

Therefore, the final result is 4.","To find out how many 5-point problems there are, we need to calculate the total number of points from all the problems and then divide that by the points per problem for 5-point problems.

First, let's calculate the total number of points from all the problems:

Total points = 200 points (test worth) + 2 points (per problem for 2-point problems) + 4 points (per problem for 4-point problems) + 5 points (per problem for 5-point problems)

Total points = 200 + (2 * 50) + (4 * 50) + (5 * 50)
Total points = 200 + 100 + 200 + 250
Total points = 850

Now, let's divide the total points by the points per problem for 5-point problems:

Number of 5-point problems = Total points / Points per 5-point problem
Number of 5-point problems = 850 / 5
Number of 5-point problems = 170

937,"On a test containing 150 questions, the final score is based on 1 point for each correct answer, 0.25 of a point subtracted for each incorrect answer, and no points added or subtracted for unanswered questions. Allan answered all but 'x' questions and received a final score of 110 points. How many questions did Allan answer correctly?","Let's denote the number of questions Allan answered correctly as 'c'. Since Allan did not answer 'x' questions, he answered a total of 150 - x questions. Out of these, 'c' were correct, and the remaining (150 - x - c) were incorrect.

For each correct answer, Allan gets 1 point, so for 'c' correct answers, he gets 'c' points. For each incorrect answer, Allan loses 0.25 points, so for (150 - x - c) incorrect answers, he loses 0.25 * (150 - x - c) points.

The final score is the total points from correct answers minus the points lost for incorrect answers. Allan's final score is 110 points, so we can set up the following equation:

c - 0.25 * (150 - x - c) = 110

Now, let's solve for 'c':

c - 0.25 * (150 - x - c) = 110
c - 37.5 + 0.25x + 0.25c = 110
c + 0.25c = 110 + 37.5 - 0.25x
1.25c = 147.5 - 0.25x

Now, we need to isolate 'c':

c = (147.5 - 0.25x) / 1.25

To find the number of questions Allan answered correctly, we need to know the value of 'x', which is the number of questions he did not answer. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact number of questions Allan answered correctly. However, we have the formula to calculate 'c' once 'x' is known.","Allan answered 100 questions correctly. 

The final result is 100.","Let's denote the number of questions Allan answered correctly as \( C \).

According to the problem, Allan answered all but \( x \) questions, so he answered \( 150 - x \) questions.

For each correct answer, Allan receives 1 point, so he gets \( C \times 1 \) points for answering \( C \) questions correctly.

For each incorrect answer, Allan loses 0.25 of a point, so he loses \( (150 - x - C) \times 0.25 \) points for answering \( 150 - x - C \) questions incorrectly.

Since Allan answered all but \( x \) questions, the number of unanswered questions is \( x \). For these unanswered questions, no points are added or subtracted, so they contribute 0 points to the final score.

The final score is the sum of the points for correct answers and the points for incorrect answers, minus the points for unanswered questions. This sum is given as 110 points.

So, we have the equation:

\[ C \times 1 + (150 - x - C) \times 0.25 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( C \):

\[ C \times 1 + 0.25 \times (150 - x - C) = 110 \]

\[ C + 0.25 \times (150 - x - C) = 110 \]

\[ C + 37.5 - 0.25C - 0.25x = 110 \]

\[ C + 37.5 - 0.25C = 110 - 0.25x \]

\[ C + 37.5 = 110 - 0.25x \]

\[ C = 110 - 0.25x - 37.5 \]

According to the problem, the middle number exceeds the smallest by 5, so we have:
\[ x+1 = x + 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x+1 = x+5 \]
\[ 1 = 5 \]
This equation does not make sense, as it implies that 1 equals 5, which is not true. It seems there might be a mistake in the interpretation of the problem statement.

Let's re-evaluate the problem statement: ""the middle number exceeds the smallest by 5"" should mean that the difference between the middle number and the smallest number is 5. However, since the numbers are consecutive, the middle number can only be 1 more than the smallest number. Therefore, the problem statement seems to be contradictory.

If we consider the second part of the problem statement, ""the middle number is less than the largest by 7,"" we can write the following equation:
\[ x+1 = (x+2) - 7 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x+1 = x-5 \]

S = L - 3 - 5
S = L - 8

So, the smallest number S is 8 less than the largest number L.

5 + x^2 = 20

Now, we need to solve for x. First, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to isolate the x^2 term:

x^2 = 20 - 5
x^2 = 15

Next, take the square root of both sides to solve for x. Remember that there will be two solutions, one positive and one negative, because squaring either a positive or negative number will give a positive result:

x = √15 or x = -√15

So the number could be either the positive square root of 15 or the negative square root of 15.","We are looking for a number whose square is 15, because adding 5 to that number would give us 20. The square root of 15 is 3.5, but we need to subtract 5 from the final result. Therefore, the number is **3**.","Let's call the number we are looking for x. According to the problem, the sum of 5 and the square of x is 20. We can write this as an equation:

x^2 = 20 - 5
x^2 = 15

Now, we have the square of x equal to 15. To find x, we need to take the square root of both sides:

√(x^2) = √(15)

According to the information given:
1. The total number of games played is 120.
2. They lost 38 more games than they won.
3. They didn't tie any games.

From this, we can set up the following equations:

W + L = 120 (since the total number of games played is the sum of wins and losses)

L = W + 38 (since they lost 38 more games than they won)

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for W:

W + (W + 38) = 120
2W + 38 = 120
2W = 120 - 38
2W = 82
W = 82 / 2
W = 41

So the Tigers won 41 games that season.","We know that the Tigers played a total of 120 games and lost 38 more than they won.

We can represent the number of wins with the variable 'x'. Therefore, the Tigers:
• Lost 38 + x games
• Won x games
• Played 120 games

We will subtract the number of losses from the total games played to find the number of wins:
120 - (38 + x) = x

Simplifying this equation, we get:
82 - 38 = x

So x = 44

Therefore, the final result is 44.
Forty-four.","Let's denote the number of games the Tigers won as W. According to the information given, they lost 38 more games than they won. So, the number of games they lost is W + 38.

W + (W + 38) = 120

To solve for W, we first combine like terms:

W + W = 2W
W + 38 = 38

He has 14 shares of the more valuable stock and 26 shares of the other stock. In addition, he has a bond with a face value of 1000 dollars that pays a 6% annual coupon rate, which he purchased at a 3% discount. His total assets in stocks and the bond is 2106 dollars, but the market rates have been fluctuating. Let the value of the more expensive stock per share be x, and the current market value of the bond be y. How much is the more expensive stock per share and the current market value of the bond?","Let's start by setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let x be the value of the more expensive stock per share.
Then the value of the less expensive stock per share is x/2.

Matthew has 14 shares of the more expensive stock, so the total value of these shares is 14x.
He has 26 shares of the less expensive stock, so the total value of these shares is 26 * (x/2) = 13x.

The bond has a face value of $1000 and was purchased at a 3% discount, so the purchase price of the bond is 1000 * (1 - 0.03) = 1000 * 0.97 = $970. However, the current market value of the bond is y, which we need to find.

The total value of Matthew's assets in stocks and the bond is $2106. So, we can write the equation as:

14x + 13x + y = 2106

Combining the x terms, we get:

27x + y = 2106  ...(1)

We are given that the bond pays a 6% annual coupon rate, which means it pays 0.06 * 1000 = $60 per year. However, this information does not directly affect the current market value of the bond, which is y.

We have two variables (x and y) and only one equation, so we need more information to solve for both variables. If there is no additional information about how the market rates have affected the bond's value, we cannot solve for y. However, we can express y in terms of x using equation (1):

y = 2106 - 27x

Without additional information, we can only solve for x if we have another equation that relates x and y. If there is no further information, we can only say that the value of the more expensive stock per share (x) and the current market value of the bond (y) are related by the equation y = 2106 - 27x.","Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1: We're given that the total value of Matthew's stocks and bond is $2106, and the more expensive stock is worth twice as much per share as the other stock. We can assume the cheaper stock is worth $x, so the more expensive one is worth $2x. We're also given that Matthew has 14 shares of the expensive stock and 26 shares of the cheap stock. 

2: We need to determine the value of the bond. We know the face value is $1000 and it was purchased at a 3% discount, so the current value of the bond is 0.97 * $1000 = $970. 

3: Now, we can calculate the total value of the stocks. The cheap stock is worth 14 * $x + 26 * $2x = 50x. Adding the value of the more expensive stock, we get 40x + 50x = $2106, so x = $18. 

Therefore, the more expensive stock is worth $36 per share, and the current market value of the bond is $970. 

$528","Let's denote the value of the more expensive stock per share as x. We know that the less expensive stock is worth half as much per share, so its value per share is x/2.

Matthew has 14 shares of the more expensive stock, so the total value of these shares is 14x.

He also has 26 shares of the less expensive stock, so the total value of these shares is 26(x/2) = 13x.

Now, let's denote the current market value of the bond as y. We know that the bond has a face value of 1000 dollars and pays a 6% annual coupon rate, which means it pays 60 dollars per year. Since it was purchased at a 3% discount, the actual coupon rate is 6% + 3% = 9%.

The current market value of the bond is the face value plus the total amount of the discount. The total amount of the discount is the face value times the discount rate, which is 1000 * 3% = 3000 dollars.

So, the current market value of the bond is 1000 + 3000 = 4000 dollars.

Now, let's add up the total value of the stocks and the bond to match the given total assets:

14x + 13x + 4000 = 2106
27x + 4000 = 2106
27x = 2106 - 4000
27x = 1706
x = 1706 / 27
x = 63.2222...

Since the value of the more expensive stock per share is not usually a fraction, we can round x to the nearest whole number. The value of the more expensive stock per share is approximately 63 dollars.

Now, let's find the current market value of the bond:

y = 4000

So, the current market value of the bond is 4000 dollars.",$528,63,2106

1. The difference between the two numbers is 5:
\[ y - x = 5 \]

2. Three times the smaller number subtracted from twice the larger number equals 40:
\[ 2y - 3x = 40 \]

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. I'll use substitution in this case.

From the first equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = x + 5 \]

Now we substitute \( y \) in the second equation with \( x + 5 \):
\[ 2(x + 5) - 3x = 40 \]

Expand the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 - 3x = 40 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ -x + 10 = 40 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ -x = 30 \]

Multiply both sides by -1 to find \( x \):
\[ x = -30 \]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find \( y \) using the first equation:
\[ y = x + 5 \]
\[ y = -30 + 5 \]
\[ y = -25 \]

So the smaller number is -30 and the larger number is -25.","We have an equation: 2x - 3y = 40, where x and y are our unknown numbers. 

We can solve this by first adding 3y to both sides, giving us 2x = 40 + 3y. Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: x = 20 + 1.5y. 

Substituting this back into our first equation, we now have 1.5y - 3y = 20. Solving for y, we find that y = 13.33..., and x = 30.

The first restrictor reduces the flow to 75% of the original flow rate, so after the first restrictor, the flow rate is:

\[ 0.40 \times 0.75F = 0.30F \]

According to the information given, after the third restrictor, the flow rate is 2 gallons per minute. This flow rate is also 1 gallon per minute less than 0.6 times the flow rate after the second restrictor. So we can write:

To solve for x, we need to get all the terms involving x on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 25 to both sides of the equation:

2x + 25 = 3x

Now, we have a simple equation where the coefficients of x are the same on both sides. To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator for the coefficients of x, which is 3 in this case. So we multiply the entire equation by 3 to get:

6x + 75 = 9x

According to the problem, the second number is 7 less than thrice the first number, so the second number can be represented as \( 3x - 7 \).

The third number is 2 more than twice the first number, so the third number can be represented as \( 2x + 2 \).

The sum of the three numbers is 168, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (3x - 7) + (2x + 2) = 168 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + 3x + 2x - 7 + 2 = 168 \]
\[ 6x - 5 = 168 \]

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation, we get:

Step 2: We subtract 164 from both sides:

3y + x - 17 + 2z = 4

Step 3: We divide everything by 2:

y = 168 - (x + z)

Step 6: Finally, we have all our equations in terms of x and z, which we can solve using the sum:

This simplifies to 9x = 30, so x = 10. Plugging this into z = 168 - 11x yields z = 58.

Therefore, the final result is 58.","Let's denote the first number as x. According to the problem, the second number is 7 less than thrice the first number, so the second number is 3x - 7. The third number is 2 more than twice the first number, so the third number is 2x + 2.

The sum of all three numbers is given as 168, so we can write the equation:

x + (3x - 7) + (2x + 2) = 168

Combining like terms, we get:

6x - 5 = 168

Now, we solve for x:

6x = 168 + 5
6x = 173
x = 173 / 6
x = 28.8333...

Since we can't have a fraction of a number for the first number, we need to check if the second and third numbers are consistent with the given sum.

The second number is 3x - 7, which is approximately 3 * 28.8333... - 7 = 86.4999... - 7 = 79.4999...

The third number is 2x + 2, which is approximately 2 * 28.8333... + 2 = 57.6666... + 2 = 59.6666...

Now, let's calculate the sum of all three numbers:

x + (3x - 7) + (2x + 2) = 28.8333... + 79.4999... + 59.6666... = 168

This matches the given sum, so the third number is approximately 59.6666...",58,59.6666,60
946,"John and Jane both have long distance phone plans. John pays a $5 monthly fee plus 25 cents per minute, while Jane pays a $7 monthly fee plus 30 cents per minute. Last month, John's long distance bill was $15.50, and Jane's bill was $18.90. How many minutes were John and Jane each billed for, respectively?","Let's denote the number of minutes John was billed for as \( J \) and the number of minutes Jane was billed for as \( N \).

For John, the total bill is composed of a $5 monthly fee plus 25 cents per minute. So his bill can be represented by the equation:
\[ 5 + 0.25J = 15.50 \]

For Jane, the total bill is composed of a $7 monthly fee plus 30 cents per minute. So her bill can be represented by the equation:
\[ 7 + 0.30N = 18.90 \]

Now, let's solve these equations for \( J \) and \( N \) to find out how many minutes they were each billed for.

For John:
\[ 0.25J = 15.50 - 5 \]
\[ 0.25J = 10.50 \]
\[ J = \frac{10.50}{0.25} \]
\[ J = 42 \]

So, John was billed for 42 minutes.

For Jane:
\[ 0.30N = 18.90 - 7 \]
\[ 0.30N = 11.90 \]
\[ N = \frac{11.90}{0.30} \]
\[ N = 39.67 \]

Since the number of minutes billed is typically a whole number, we can round Jane's minutes to the nearest whole number, which is 40 minutes.

Therefore, John was billed for 42 minutes and Jane was billed for 40 minutes, respectively.","We're asked to find how many minutes John and Jane were billed for, where John's monthly fee is $5 and Jane's is $7. John's bill last month was $15.50 and Jane's was $18.90. We can solve this problem with simultaneous equations:
1) $5 + 0.25 * x = $15.50
2) $7 + 0.30 * y = $18.90

We'll solve these equations by subtracting the monthly fees from the total costs:
1) 0.25 * x = $15.50 - $5 = $10.50
2) 0.30 * y = $18.90 - $7 = $11.90

Now we can solve for each variable:
1) x = $10.50 / 0.25 = 42 minutes
2) y = $11.90 / 0.30 = 39.67 minutes (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Therefore, the total number of minutes John was billed for is 42 minutes, and Jane was billed for 39.67 minutes.

**71.67**","Let's denote the number of minutes John and Jane were billed for as M.

John's monthly fee is $5, and he is billed 25 cents per minute. So, his total cost per minute is $0.25.

Jane's monthly fee is $7, and she is billed 30 cents per minute. So, her total cost per minute is $0.30.

Last month, John's long distance bill was $15.50, which includes the monthly fee and the cost per minute. To find out how many minutes he was billed for, we divide the total cost by the cost per minute:

M (minutes for John) = Total cost for John / Cost per minute for John
M = $15.50 / $0.25
M = 62 minutes

Jane's long distance bill was $18.90, which also includes the monthly fee and the cost per minute. To find out how many minutes she was billed for, we divide the total cost by the cost per minute:

M (minutes for Jane) = Total cost for Jane / Cost per minute for Jane
M = $18.90 / $0.30
M = 63 minutes

So, John was billed for 62 minutes, and Jane was billed for 63 minutes.",71 and two thirds,62 and 63,forty-two forty
947,A garage owner wants to fill a 75 gallon drum with a 30 percent winter mixture of antifreeze for his customers. How many gallons of an 80 percent antifreeze should he mix with some 15 percent and 45 percent antifreeze mixture in order to fill the drum?,"Let's denote the amount of 80% antifreeze as x gallons, the amount of 15% antifreeze as y gallons, and the amount of 45% antifreeze as z gallons. We have three conditions to satisfy:

1. The total volume of the mixture should be 75 gallons:
\[ x + y + z = 75 \]

2. The final mixture should be 30% antifreeze:
\[ 0.80x + 0.15y + 0.45z = 0.30 \times 75 \]

3. We need to find the values of x, y, and z that satisfy both conditions.

Let's solve the second equation for the total amount of antifreeze in the mixture:
\[ 0.80x + 0.15y + 0.45z = 22.5 \]

Now, we have two equations with three unknowns, which means we have one degree of freedom. This implies that we can choose a value for one of the variables and solve for the other two. However, we are not given any specific information about the ratio of 15% to 45% antifreeze mixture, so we cannot determine the exact amounts of y and z without additional information.

If we assume that we are not using the 15% antifreeze mixture (y = 0), we can solve for x and z. Let's do that:

1. \( x + z = 75 \) (since y = 0)
2. \( 0.80x + 0.45z = 22.5 \)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

From equation 2:
\[ 0.80x = 22.5 - 0.45z \]
\[ x = \frac{22.5 - 0.45z}{0.80} \]

Substitute x in equation 1:
\[ \frac{22.5 - 0.45z}{0.80} + z = 75 \]
\[ 22.5 - 0.45z + 0.80z = 75 \times 0.80 \]
\[ 0.35z = 60 - 22.5 \]
\[ z = \frac{37.5}{0.35} \]
\[ z = 107.14 \]

However, this value of z is not possible because it exceeds the total volume of the drum (75 gallons). This means we cannot make the mixture with only 80% and 45% antifreeze without using some of the 15% antifreeze.

Without a specific ratio of 15% to 45% antifreeze, we cannot determine the exact amounts of each component needed to create the 30% mixture. Additional information is required to solve this problem completely.","To create a 30 percent winter mixture, we should aim for 30 parts of antifreeze for every 70 parts of solution. 

We have two mixtures: an 80 percent antifreeze and a 15 percent antifreeze. 

We need to find out how many gallons from the 80 percent antifreeze mixture should be taken. This can be calculated as: 
8x + 15y = 30z

30z represents the 30 percent in the 75-gallon drum, so z = 75/30 = 2.5. 

Substituting z into the equation, we get: 
8x + 15y = 75

We can then solve for x to get the amount of 80 percent antifreeze needed, which gives us: 
x = 6.25

Therefore the garage owner should use **6.25** gallons of the 80 percent antifreeze.","Let's denote the amount of 80% antifreeze as x gallons.

According to the problem, the garage owner wants to fill a 75-gallon drum with a 30% winter mixture of antifreeze. This means that 30% of the 75 gallons should be antifreeze.

So, 0.30 * 75 = 22.5 gallons of antifreeze are needed.

Now, we need to find out how much of the 80% antifreeze (x gallons) and the 15% and 45% antifreeze mixture (y gallons) should be mixed to get 22.5 gallons of antifreeze.

Let's denote the amount of 15% antifreeze as y1 and the amount of 45% antifreeze as y2.

The total amount of antifreeze in the 15% and 45% mixture is y1 + y2.

The amount of antifreeze in the 15% mixture is 0.15 * y1, and the amount of antifreeze in the 45% mixture is 0.45 * y2.

So, the total amount of antifreeze in the 15% and 45% mixture is:

0.15 * y1 + 0.45 * y2

We know that the total amount of antifreeze in the 15% and 45% mixture should be 22.5 gallons. So, we can set up the equation:

0.15 * y1 + 0.45 * y2 = 22.5

Now, we need to find the value of x (the amount of 80% antifreeze) that will give us 22.5 gallons of antifreeze when mixed with the 15% and 45% antifreeze mixture.

The amount of antifreeze in the 80% mixture is 0.80 * x.

So, the total amount of antifreeze in the 80% mixture and the 15% and 45% mixture should be 22.5 gallons. We can set up the equation:

0.80 * x + (0.15 * y1 + 0.45 * y2) = 22.5

Now, we need to find the values of x, y1, and y2 that satisfy this equation. Since we are looking for the value of x, we can express y1 and y2 in terms of x.

Let's assume that the amount of 15% antifreeze is y1 gallons and the amount of 45% antifreeze is y2 gallons. We know that the total amount of antif",6.25,25,undetermined

The sum of the two numbers is given as 36.8. So we can write the equation:

3x + 5x = 36.8

Combining like terms, we get:

8x = 36.8

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 36.8 / 8
x = 4.6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the two numbers:

Additionally, there's a 2 dollar shipping fee for each candle sold and a 7% sales tax on the revenue. How many candles must you sell to have a profit of 85 dollars?","Let's calculate the cost of making each candle first. If the material to make up to 20 candles costs $20, then the cost per candle is:

$20 / 20 candles = $1 per candle

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each candle sold, including the shipping fee:

Cost per candle + Shipping fee = $1 + $2 = $3 per candle

Next, we need to calculate the revenue for each candle sold, taking into account the 7% sales tax. The sales tax is applied to the selling price of $15, so the total revenue per candle is:

Sales tax = 7% of $15 = 0.07 * $15 = $1.05

Revenue per candle including sales tax = Selling price + Sales tax = $15 + $1.05 = $16.05

Now, let's calculate the profit for each candle sold by subtracting the total cost from the revenue:

Profit per candle = Revenue per candle - Total cost per candle = $16.05 - $3 = $13.05

Finally, to find out how many candles you need to sell to have a profit of $85, we divide the desired profit by the profit per candle:

Number of candles to sell = Desired profit / Profit per candle = $85 / $13.05 ≈ 6.51

Since you can't sell a fraction of a candle, you would need to sell 7 candles to achieve a profit of at least $85.","To have a profit of $85, you need to sell:

4 candles.

The step-by-step solutions are as follows:

1. The cost of materials for 20 candles is $20, and the shipping fee is $2 per candle. So, the total cost for 20 candles is $40 + $40 = $80.

2. To make a profit of $85, the revenue should be $85 plus the cost of materials and shipping: $85 + $80 = $165.

3. 165 / 15 = 11 (candles)

The revenue of 11 candles minus the cost of making and shipping them (11 x 2 = $22) gives a profit of $165 - $22 = $143.

4. As the question asks for the number of candles needed to make a profit of $85, we subtract the number of candles already accounted for in the previous solution: 11 candles - 4 candles = 7 candles. Or, as a single number, 7.

Seven.","First, let's calculate the total cost of making the candles. Since the material for 20 candles costs 20 dollars, the cost per candle is 20 dollars / 20 candles = 1 dollar per candle.

Now, let's calculate the total cost per candle including the shipping fee and sales tax. The shipping fee is 2 dollars per candle, and the sales tax is 7% of the selling price, which is 15 dollars. So, the sales tax is 0.07 * 15 dollars = 1.05 dollars per candle.

The total cost per candle is the cost of the material plus the shipping fee plus the sales tax, which is 1 dollar + 2 dollars + 1.05 dollars = 4.05 dollars per candle.

Now, let's calculate the profit per candle. The profit per candle is the selling price minus the total cost per candle, which is 15 dollars - 4.05 dollars = 10.95 dollars per candle.

To find out how many candles you must sell to have a profit of 85 dollars, we divide the desired profit by the profit per candle:

85 dollars / 10.95 dollars per candle = 7.78 candles.

951,"If 1.3333 times a number x minus half of another number y is equal to 4.82, and the product of x and y is 36, find the values of x and y.","Let's set up the equations based on the information given:

1.3333 * x - 0.5 * y = 4.82  (Equation 1)
x * y = 36  (Equation 2)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

First, let's isolate y in Equation 2:

y = 36 / x  (Equation 3)

Now, we can substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1 to solve for x:

1.3333 * x - 0.5 * (36 / x) = 4.82

Multiply through by x to clear the fraction:

1.3333 * x^2 - 0.5 * 36 = 4.82 * x

Now, let's rearrange the equation to set it to zero:

1.3333 * x^2 - 4.82 * x - 18 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

In this case, a = 1.3333, b = -4.82, and c = -18. Let's calculate the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) first:

Discriminant = (-4.82)^2 - 4 * 1.3333 * (-18)
Discriminant = 23.2324 + 95.9976
Discriminant = 119.23

Since the discriminant is positive, we have two real solutions for x. Now, let's find the values of x:

x = [4.82 ± sqrt(119.23)] / (2 * 1.3333)

Let's calculate the two possible values for x:

x1 = (4.82 + sqrt(119.23)) / 2.6666
x2 = (4.82 - sqrt(119.23)) / 2.6666

Now, we can use a calculator to find the approximate values of x1 and x2:

x1 ≈ (4.82 + 10.92) / 2.6666
x1 ≈ 15.74 / 2.6666
x1 ≈ 5.9

x2 ≈ (4.82 - 10.92) / 2.6666
x2 ≈ -6.1 / 2.6666
x2 ≈ -2.29

Since x and y are both real numbers and the product xy = 36, we can discard the negative value for x because a negative x would require a negative y to maintain a positive product, which is not possible in this context.

So, we have x ≈ 5.9. Now we can find y using Equation 3:

y = 36 / x
y = 36 / 5.9
y ≈ 6.1

Therefore, the approximate values of x and y are 5.9 and 6.1, respectively.","We're looking for the values of x and y based on the given equation:

x * y = 36

We can solve this simultaneously using integer coefficients:
2x - y = 8
x * y = 36

This simplifies to:

2x = 8 + y
xy = 36

1.3333 * X - 0.5 * Y = 4.82

We also know that the product of X and Y is 36:

X * Y = 36

Now, we can solve for X and Y using the first equation. First, let's express Y in terms of X:

1.3333 * X - 0.5 * Y = 4.82
0.5 * Y = 4.82 - 1.3333 * X
Y = (4.82 - 1.3333 * X) / 0.5

Now, we can substitute this expression for Y into the second equation to solve for X:

X * (4.82 - 1.3333 * X) = 36

To solve for X, we need to find the value of X that makes this equation true. We can do this by rearranging the equation:

36 = X * (4.82 - 1.3333 * X)
36 / (4.82 - 1.3333 * X) = X

Now, we need to find the value of X that makes this equation true. Since we have a quadratic term involving X, we can factor it out:

36 = X * (4.82 - 1.3333 * X)
36 = 4.82X - 1.3333X^2

Now, let's factor out the X term:

36 = X(4.82 - 1.3333X)
36 = X(4.82 - X)

36 = 4.82X - X^2

Now, let's divide both sides by 4.82 - X to solve for X:

(36 / (4.82 - X)) = X

Expanding the equation, we get:

2y^2 - 2y = 48

To solve for y, we need to rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form:

2y^2 - 2y - 48 = 0

Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:

y^2 - y - 24 = 0

Now, we need to factor the quadratic equation:

(y - 4)(y + 6) = 0

This gives us two possible solutions for y:

y - 4 = 0  or  y + 6 = 0

Solving for y in each case:

y = 4  or  y = -6

Since we are looking for a positive product (48), we will consider the positive value of y:

y = 4

Now, we can find x using the original equation x = 2y - 2:

x = 2(4) - 2

      x = 2y - 2
      Add 2 to both sides: x + 2 = 2y

      Block out the solution:

      y = sqrt(x + 2)

Now we substitute this expression back into the equation above: 

      x = 2 * sqrt(x + 2) - 2

We have an equation which only involves x, so we can find the solutions by setting it equal to the known product, 48: 

      x = 2 * sqrt(x + 2) - 2 = 48

We have a quadratic equation in x:

x^2 + 2x = 96

To solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first:

x^2 + 2x - 96 = 0

This equation is of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = 2, and c = -96. We can factor this equation as follows:

(x + 12)(x - 8) = 0

Now, let's solve for x:

x + 12 = 0 or x - 8 = 0

x = -12 or x = 8

Since x cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -12. Therefore, x = 8.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y using the equation x = 2y - 2:

y = (x + 2) / 2
y = (8 + 2) / 2
y = 10 / 2
y = 5

So, the two numbers are x = 8 and y = 5.",623,8 and 5,6 and 4
953,"Let x and y be two unknown numbers such that the difference between 3 times x and 1 is the same as twice y. Additionally, the product of x and y equals y squared minus 2. Write a system of equations to find the values of x and y.","Let's translate the given information into mathematical equations.

1. The difference between 3 times x and 1 is the same as twice y:
3x - 1 = 2y

2. The product of x and y equals y squared minus 2:
xy = y^2 - 2

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) 3x - 1 = 2y
2) xy = y^2 - 2

This system can be used to find the values of x and y.","We're given the equation ""3x - 1 = 2y"" and we know that ""xy = y^2 - 2."" 

We can solve this by first adding one to both sides of the equation 3x - 1 = 2y, which results in 3x = 2y + 1. We can then divide both sides by 2 to get x = y + 1/2. 

Substituting this into the equation xy = y^2 - 2 gives us (y + 1/2)y = y^2 - 2, which we can simplify to 1/2y + y^2 = y^2 - 2. This simplifies further to y^2 + 1/2y = 2, or 3/2y = 2. 

The solution to this equation is y = 4/3. Substituting this into the equation x = y + 1/2 gives x = 7/6.

**7/6**","Let's denote the two unknown numbers as x and y. According to the problem, the difference between 3 times x and 1 is the same as twice y. This can be written as an equation:

3x - 1 = 2y

We are also given that the product of x and y equals y squared minus 2:

x * y = y^2 - 2

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) 3x - 1 = 2y
2) x * y = y^2 - 2

To solve for x and y, we need to express one of the variables in terms of the other and then substitute that expression into the other equation. Let's express x in terms of y:

From the first equation, we can express x as:

x = (2y + 1) / 3

Now we substitute this expression for x into the second equation:

(2y + 1) / 3 * y = y^2 - 2

Now we solve for y:

y * (2y + 1) / 3 = y^2 - 2

y * (2y + 1) = 3y^2 - 6

Cross-multiply to solve for y:

3y^2 - 6y = 2y + 1

y^2 - 2y = 1

Now we factor the quadratic equation:

(y - 1)(y + 1) = 0

This gives us two possible values for y:

y = 1 or y = -1

Now we can substitute these values for y back into the first equation to find x:

For y = 1:

x = (2 * 1 + 1) / 3
x = (3 + 1) / 3
x = 4 / 3
x = 4 / 3 * 3 / 3
x = 1

For y = -1:

x = (2 * (-1) + 1) / 3
x = (-2 + 1) / 3
x = -1 / 3
x = -1 / 3 * 3 / 3
x = -1

So the values for x and y that satisfy the given conditions are:

x = 1, y = 1
or
x = -1, y = -1

Therefore, the values of x and y that satisfy the given conditions are x = 1 and y = 1, or x = -1 and y = -1.",seven six,"1,-1",2y - 3x = -1.
954,"If your gross pay is 4500 dollars and you have three different tax rates applied to your income: 10% for the first 1500 dollars, 15% for the next 2000 dollars, and 20% on the remaining amount, along with a 100 dollar standard deduction, how much do you pay in taxes? Assume that all tax dollars are not included in the net pay.","First, we need to calculate the tax for each portion of the income:

1. For the first $1500, the tax rate is 10%:
Tax on first $1500 = 10% of $1500 = 0.10 * $1500 = $150

2. For the next $2000, the tax rate is 15%:
Tax on next $2000 = 15% of $2000 = 0.15 * $2000 = $300

3. The remaining amount of the income is $4500 - $1500 - $2000 = $1000, and the tax rate is 20%:
Tax on remaining $1000 = 20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, we add up the taxes from each portion:
Total tax = Tax on first $1500 + Tax on next $2000 + Tax on remaining $1000
Total tax = $150 + $300 + $200 = $650

Next, we apply the standard deduction of $100:
Tax after deduction = Total tax - Standard deduction
Tax after deduction = $650 - $100 = $550

Therefore, you would pay $550 in taxes.","We have gross pay of $4500, which we will calculate taxes for. 

The first $1500 is taxed at 10%, so we charge 0.10 x $1500 = $150. The next $2000 is taxed at 15%, resulting in a charge of 0.15 x $2000 = $300. 
For the remaining $1000, the tax rate is 20%, which equals 0.20 x $1000 = $200. 

Adding these together, we get a total tax amount of $650. Subtracting this from the gross pay of $4500, we get a net pay of $3850. 

Therefore, the final result is three thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars.","First, let's calculate the tax for each rate:

1. For the first $1500, the tax rate is 10%. So, the tax is:
   10% of $1500 = 0.10 * $1500 = $150

2. For the next $2000, the tax rate is 15%. So, the tax is:
   15% of $2000 = 0.15 * $2000 = $300

3. For the remaining amount, the tax rate is 20%. Let's find out how much is left after the first $1500 and the next $2000:
   $4500 (total gross pay) - $1500 (first $1500) - $2000 (next $2000) = $1000

   Now, calculate the tax for the remaining $1000:
   20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, let's add up all the taxes:
$150 (tax for the first $1500) + $300 (tax for the next $2000) + $200 (tax for the remaining $1000) = $650

Finally, let's subtract the standard deduction of $100 from the total tax:
$650 (total tax) - $100 (standard deduction) = $550

955,"If 120 lollipops cost 90 dollars before a 15% discount, what is the cost of 1 lollipop after applying the discount, in dollars?","First, let's find the cost of 120 lollipops after applying the 15% discount.

The discount amount on the original price of $90 is:
15% of $90 = 0.15 * $90 = $13.50

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the discounted price:
$90 - $13.50 = $76.50

This is the cost of 120 lollipops after the discount. To find the cost of 1 lollipop, we divide this amount by the number of lollipops:

$76.50 / 120 lollipops = $0.6375 per lollipop

So, the cost of 1 lollipop after applying the 15% discount is approximately $0.64 (rounded to the nearest cent).","The cost of the lollipops before discount is 90 dollars for 120 pieces, which equates to $0.75 per lollipop. After the 15% discount is applied, the new price for one lollipop is approximately $0.63. 

$0.63.","First, we need to calculate the total discount on the 120 lollipops. Since the discount is 15%, we can calculate the discount amount by multiplying the total cost before the discount by the discount percentage:

Discount amount = Total cost before discount * Discount percentage
Discount amount = 90 * 0.15
Discount amount = 13.5

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount to find the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
Total cost after discount = 90 - 13.5
Total cost after discount = 76.5

Next, we divide the total cost after the discount by the number of lollipops to find the cost of 1 lollipop after the discount:

Cost of 1 lollipop after discount = Total cost after discount / Number of lollipops
Cost of 1 lollipop after discount = 76.5 / 120
Cost of 1 lollipop after discount = 0.6375

Since the cost of 1 lollipop after the discount is not a whole number, we can round it to the nearest cent for practical purposes. Therefore, the cost of 1 lollipop after applying the discount is approximately $0.64.",0.63,0.64,0.64
956,"A car rents for 30 dollars per day plus 18 cents per mile. Additionally, there is a mandatory insurance fee of 10 dollars per day for each rental. You are on a budget of 75 dollars for a single day rental and you need to travel a minimum of 100 miles. What additional mileage would allow you to stay within your budget considering the added insurance fee?","First, let's calculate the total fixed costs for the car rental and insurance fee for one day:

Car rental per day: $30
Insurance fee per day: $10
Total fixed costs: $30 + $10 = $40

Now, let's calculate how much of your budget is left for mileage after the fixed costs:

Budget: $75
Fixed costs: $40
Remaining budget for mileage: $75 - $40 = $35

The cost per mile is 18 cents, which is $0.18 per mile. To find out how many miles you can travel with the remaining budget, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per mile:

Remaining budget for mileage: $35
Cost per mile: $0.18
Maximum additional miles: $35 / $0.18 ≈ 194.44 miles

However, you need to travel a minimum of 100 miles, so let's calculate the cost for the first 100 miles:

Cost for 100 miles: 100 miles * $0.18/mile = $18

Now, let's subtract the cost for the first 100 miles from the remaining budget to find out how much budget is left for additional mileage:

Remaining budget after 100 miles: $35 - $18 = $17

Finally, let's calculate the additional mileage you can travel with the remaining budget:

Additional mileage budget: $17
Cost per mile: $0.18
Additional miles: $17 / $0.18 ≈ 94.44 miles

Therefore, you can travel approximately an additional 94 miles while staying within your budget of $75, after accounting for the mandatory 100 miles.","To solve this problem, we should first break down the cost structure:

1. The base rental cost is $30 per day. 
2. We need to add the cost for mileage at 18 cents per mile. 100 miles would cost $18. 
3. The insurance fee adds another $10 per day.

With a budget of $75, we can subtract the daily rental and insurance costs to find the remaining amount for mileage: 

$75 - ($30 + $10) = $45 

This leaves $45 for mileage at a rate of 18 cents per mile. $45 will cover 250 miles because 45 / 0.18 = 250.

**250 miles**","First, let's calculate the total cost for the mandatory insurance fee and the base rental cost for one day:

Insurance fee: 10 dollars per day
Base rental cost: 30 dollars per day

Total cost for one day = Insurance fee + Base rental cost
Total cost for one day = 10 dollars + 30 dollars
Total cost for one day = 40 dollars

Now, let's calculate the cost per mile for the rental:

Cost per mile = 18 cents per mile

To find out how many miles you can travel within your budget, we need to divide the total cost for one day by the cost per mile:

Miles within budget = Total cost for one day / Cost per mile
Miles within budget = 40 dollars / 0.18 dollars per mile
Miles within budget = 222.22 miles

Since you need to travel a minimum of 100 miles, you can stay within your budget for the first 100 miles.

To find out how many additional miles you can travel while still staying within your budget, we subtract the minimum miles from the total miles within budget:

Additional miles = Total miles within budget - Minimum miles
Additional miles = 222.22 miles - 100 miles
Additional miles = 122.22 miles

We have three pieces of information that can be translated into equations:

1. The total amount invested is 15,000 dollars:
\[ x + y + z = 15,000 \]

2. The total interest earned after 1 year is 1,252.25 dollars. The interest from each account can be calculated as follows:
\[ 0.065x + 0.08y + 0.095z = 1,252.25 \]

3. Since we have three variables and only two equations, we need one more equation to solve the system. We can assume any value for one of the variables and solve for the other two, or we can look for additional information that might have been provided. If no additional information is given, we can only solve for the variables in terms of each other.

Let's assume the amount invested in the account earning 9.5% annual interest is z dollars. We can express x and y in terms of z using the first equation:
\[ x = 15,000 - y - z \]

Now we can substitute x in the second equation and solve for y and z:
\[ 0.065(15,000 - y - z) + 0.08y + 0.095z = 1,252.25 \]

Expanding the equation, we get:

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Divide the total investment equally into the three rates: 
$A = 15000 x (r1 / (r1 + r2 + r3)) = 4500 (or 5 x 900)
$B = 15000 x (r2 / (r1 + r2 + r3)) = 5400 (or 6 x 900)
$C = 15000 x (r3 / (r1 + r2 + r3)) = 5600 (or 7 x 800)

2. Calculate the interest earned for each account:
Interest A = $4500 x 6.5% = $300
Interest B = $5400 x 8% = $432
Interest C = $5600 x 9.5% = $530.25

\[ x + y + z = 15,000 \]

The interest earned in each account is calculated by multiplying the amount invested by the annual interest rate and then dividing by 100 to get the annual interest. After 1 year, the interest earned in the first account would be:

\[ x \times 6.5\% = x \times 0.065 \]

The interest earned in the second account would be:

\[ y \times 8\% = y \times 0.08 \]

The interest earned in the third account would be:

\[ z \times 9.5\% = z \times 0.095 \]

Additionally, you can buy an armband for 20 dollars and ride unlimited for one night. Taking into account the bulk purchase discounts, at how many rides does the armband cost the same as buying individual tickets or ticket bundles?","To find out at how many rides the armband becomes cost-effective, we need to compare the cost of the armband with the cost of individual tickets and ticket bundles.

The armband costs $20 and allows for unlimited rides. We need to calculate the cost per ride for each of the ticket options and find the point at which the cost equals $20.

1. Individual tickets cost $0.75 each. To find out how many rides you would need to take to spend $20, we divide $20 by $0.75:
   $20 / $0.75 = 26.67 rides
   Since you can't take a fraction of a ride, you would need to take 27 rides to spend more than $20 on individual tickets.

2. A bundle of 5 rides costs $3.25. To find the cost per ride, we divide $3.25 by 5:
   $3.25 / 5 = $0.65 per ride
   To find out how many rides you would need to take to spend $20, we divide $20 by $0.65:

   To find out how many rides you would need to take to spend $20, we divide $20 by $0.60:
   $20 / $0.60 = 33.33 rides
   You would need to take 34 rides to spend more than $20 on 10-ride bundles.

4. A bundle of 20 rides costs $10. To find the cost per ride, we divide $10 by 20:
   $10 / 20 = $0.50 per ride
   To find out how many rides you would need to take to spend $20, we divide $20 by $0.50:
   $20 / $0.50 = 40 rides
   You would need to take 40 rides to spend exactly $20 on 20-ride bundles.

Therefore, the armband becomes cost-effective at:
- 27 rides when compared to individual tickets
- 31 rides when compared to 5-ride bundles
- 34 rides when compared to 10-ride bundles
- 40 rides when compared to 20-ride bundles

The armband is the best value if you plan to ride more than 27 times, as it costs the same or less than any other option once you reach that number of rides.","To solve this problem, we need to find the breakpoint at which the armband price equals the bundle or individual ticket prices. 

We start by calculating the cost of individual tickets. One ride ticket is 0.75 dollars, so 20 rides would cost 15 dollars.

Next, we compare this to the armband price of 20 dollars. This means that the breakpoint where the two prices equal each other is at 15 rides. 

The result is 15.","Let's calculate the cost per ride for each option:

1. Individual tickets:
   Cost per ticket = $0.75
   Cost per ride = $0.75

2. Bundle of 5 rides:
   Cost per bundle = $3.25
   Cost per ride = $3.25 / 5 = $0.65

3. Bundle of 10 rides:
   Cost per bundle = $6
   Cost per ride = $6 / 10 = $0.60

4. Bundle of 20 rides:
   Cost per bundle = $10
   Cost per ride = $10 / 20 = $0.50

5. Armband:
   Cost per armband = $20
   Cost per ride = $20 / (1 night with unlimited rides) = $20

Now, let's find the number of rides at which the armband cost matches the cost per ride of the individual tickets or ticket bundles:

For the armband to cost the same as buying individual tickets, we need to find the number of rides that would cost $0.75 per ride:

Number of rides = Total cost / Cost per ride
Number of rides = $20 / $0.75
Number of rides = 26.666666666666666

Since we can't have a fraction of a ride, we'll round to the nearest whole number. The armband costs the same as buying individual tickets when it allows you to ride approximately 27 times.

For the armband to cost the same as buying the bundle of 5 rides, we need to find the number of rides that would cost $0.65 per ride:

Number of rides = Total cost / Cost per ride
Number of rides = $20 / $0.65
Number of rides = 30.76923076923077

Since we can't have a fraction of a ride, we'll round to the nearest whole number. The armband costs the same as buying the bundle of 5 rides when it allows you to ride approximately 31 times.

For the armband to cost the same as buying the bundle of 10 rides, we need to find the number of rides that would cost $0.60 per ride:

Number of rides = Total cost / Cost per ride
Number of rides = $20 / $0.60
Number of rides = 33.33333333333333

Since we can't have a fraction of a ride, we'll round to the nearest whole number. The armband costs the same as buying the bundle of 10 rides when it",15,33,27
961,"According to Dr. Aaron R. Folsom of the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, your maximum ideal waist size is directly proportional to your hip size. For a woman with 40-inch hips, the maximum ideal waist size is 32 inches. If a woman with 35-inch hips also has a 10% increase in her hip size, what is the new maximum waist size based on the adjusted hip size?","First, let's calculate the new hip size after a 10% increase:

New hip size = Original hip size + (10% of Original hip size)
New hip size = 35 inches + (10/100 * 35 inches)
New hip size = 35 inches + 3.5 inches
New hip size = 38.5 inches

Now, we know that the maximum ideal waist size is directly proportional to the hip size. Since a woman with 40-inch hips has a maximum ideal waist size of 32 inches, we can set up a proportion to find the new maximum waist size for the woman with 38.5-inch hips.

Let's call the new maximum waist size W. The proportion is as follows:

40-inch hips : 32-inch waist = 38.5-inch hips : W-inch waist

Now we can solve for W:

(40/32) = (38.5/W)
40W = 32 * 38.5
40W = 1232
W = 1232 / 40
W = 30.8 inches

So, the new maximum ideal waist size for a woman with 38.5-inch hips would be 30.8 inches.","To solve this problem, we first need to find the increase in hip size. We can do this by calculating:

0.10 x 35 inches = 3.5 inches

The new hip size would be:

35 inches + 3.5 inches = 38.5 inches

According to Dr. Folsom's findings, the maximum ideal waist size is proportional to the hip size. So, we can assume that the new maximum waist size will increase by the same ratio as the hip size does.

Therefore, for a 38.5-inch hip, the new maximum waist size would be:

32 inches / 40 inches x 38.5 inches = 28.9 inches

The final result is 28.9.

Thus, the new maximum waist size is **28.9** inches.","If the woman's hips increase by 10%, we need to calculate the new hip size.

The original hip size is 35 inches.

The increase in hip size is 10% of 35 inches:
10% of 35 inches = 0.10 * 35 inches = 3.5 inches

Now, we add the increase to the original hip size:
New hip size = Original hip size + Increase
New hip size = 35 inches + 3.5 inches = 38.5 inches

Since the maximum ideal waist size is directly proportional to the hip size, we can find the new maximum waist size by taking the ratio of the new hip size to the original hip size and then applying that ratio to the original maximum waist size.

The original maximum waist size is 32 inches.

The ratio of the new hip size to the original hip size is:
Ratio = New hip size / Original hip size
Ratio = 38.5 inches / 35 inches

Now, we apply this ratio to the original maximum waist size:
New maximum waist size = Original maximum waist size * Ratio
New maximum waist size = 32 inches * (38.5 inches / 35 inches)

Let's calculate the new maximum waist size:
New maximum waist size = 32 inches * (1.092857143)
New maximum waist size ≈ 32 inches * 1.092857143
New maximum waist size ≈ 35 inches

So, the new maximum waist size based on the adjusted hip size is approximately 35 inches.",28.9,35,30.8

5x + 4 = 19

To find the value of x, we can solve this equation:

5x = 19 - 4
5x = 15
x = 15 / 5
x = 3

Now that we have the value of x, we can express the second relationship as an equation:

x + y = z

Since we know x is 3, we can substitute it into the equation:

3 + y = z

However, with the information given, we cannot determine the exact values of y and z because we have only one equation with two unknowns. We need more information to find unique values for y and z. If there is an additional relationship or value provided for either y or z, we could solve for the other variable. Otherwise, y and z can be any pair of numbers that add up to z.","1. We're shown that 5x + 4 = 19 and x + y = z. 

2. Subtracting 5x from both sides of the second equation yields y = z - x. 

3. Substituting this into the first equation yields 5x + 4 = 19 and solving for x gives x = 4. 

4. Therefore, y = z - 4, and plugging in x = 4 into either equation above yields the relationship 5 * 4 + 4 = 19, or simply z = 8.

Peace.","Let's denote the first number as x and the second number as y.

According to the problem, the product of 5 and x is increased by 4 and the result is 19. This can be written as:

5x + 4 = 19

At the same time, the sum of x and y is equal to a third number, z. This can be written as:

x + y = z

So, we have a system of two linear equations:

1) 5x + 4 = 19
2) x + y = z

To solve for x, y, and z, we need to express y in terms of x and z, and then substitute that expression into the first equation.

From the second equation, we can express y in terms of x and z:

y = z - x

Now, we substitute y in the first equation:

5x + 4 = 19
5x + 4 = 19
5x = 19 - 4
5x = 15
x = 15 / 5
x = 3

Now that we have the value of x, we can find y using the second equation:

y = z - x
y = z - 3

We don't have the value of z yet, so we can't find y. However, we can express y in terms of z:

y = z - 3

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) 5x + 4 = 19
2) y = z - 3

We have found the value of x, which is 3, but we need to know the value of z to find y. Since we don't have the value of z, we cannot determine the values of x, y, and z. We need more information about the relationship between x, y, and z to solve for all three variables.",8,3,3

Calculate the total profit percentage based on the combined selling prices of the three textbooks.","To calculate the total profit percentage based on the combined selling prices of the three textbooks, we first need to find the profit for each textbook, then sum those profits to find the total profit. After that, we will sum the selling prices of all three textbooks to find the total selling price. Finally, we will calculate the profit percentage using the total profit and the total selling price.

Let's calculate the profit for each textbook:

1. First textbook profit: Selling price - Cost price = 55 dollars - 44 dollars = 11 dollars
2. Second textbook profit: Selling price - Cost price = 72 dollars - 58 dollars = 14 dollars
3. Third textbook profit: Selling price - Cost price = 107 dollars - 83 dollars = 24 dollars

Now, let's sum the profits to find the total profit:

Total profit = First textbook profit + Second textbook profit + Third textbook profit
Total profit = 11 dollars + 14 dollars + 24 dollars
Total profit = 49 dollars

Next, let's sum the selling prices to find the total selling price:

Total selling price = First textbook selling price + Second textbook selling price + Third textbook selling price
Total selling price = 55 dollars + 72 dollars + 107 dollars
Total selling price = 234 dollars

Finally, let's calculate the profit percentage:

Profit percentage = (Total profit / Total selling price) * 100

For the second textbook:
Profit = 72 dollars - 58 dollars

How many children, adults, and senior citizens attended?","Let's denote the number of adults as A. According to the problem, there are twice as many children as adults, so the number of children is 2A. It also states that there are three times as many senior citizens as adults, so the number of senior citizens is 3A.

The total number of people at the gathering is the sum of children, adults, and senior citizens, which is given as 126. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Children + Adults + Senior Citizens = Total
2A + A + 3A = 126

Combining like terms, we get:
6A = 126

To find the number of adults, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
A = 126 / 6
A = 21

Now that we know there are 21 adults, we can find the number of children and senior citizens:
Children = 2A = 2 * 21 = 42
Senior Citizens = 3A = 3 * 21 = 63

So, there were 42 children, 21 adults, and 63 senior citizens at the gathering.","There were 24 children, 12 adults, and 36 senior citizens at the gathering. The total is 72.

7A = 126

To find the value of A, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

A = 126 / 7

A = 18

N + D + Q = 30  (1)

We also know the total value of the coins is $5.70, and we can express this in cents to make the calculations easier. So, $5.70 is equal to 570 cents. The value of each nickel is 5 cents, the value of each dime is 10 cents, and the value of each quarter is 25 cents. We can write the second equation as:

5N + 10D + 25Q = 570  (2)

We have two equations but three unknowns, which means we need another piece of information to solve for the number of nickels. However, since we are only asked for the number of nickels, we can express D and Q in terms of N and then solve for N.

From equation (1), we can express D as:

D = 30 - N - Q  (3)

Now, we can substitute equation (3) into equation (2) to get an equation with N and Q:

5N + 10(30 - N - Q) + 25Q = 570

Expanding this, we get:

5N + 300 - 10N - 10Q + 25Q = 570

Combining like terms, we get:

-5N + 15Q = 270

Now, we can express Q in terms of N:

15Q = 5N + 270
Q = (5N + 270) / 15
Q = (1/3)N + 18

Since Q must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a coin), N must be a multiple of 3. Let's try to find a value of N that satisfies this condition and also results in a whole number for Q.

If we try N = 3, we get:

Q = (1/3)(3) + 18
Q = 1 + 18
Q = 19

But if N = 3 and Q = 19, then D would be:

D = 30 - N - Q
D = 30 - 3 - 19
D = 8

This would give us a total value of:

5(3) + 10(8) + 25(19) = 15 + 80 + 475 = 570 cents

So, Sam has 3 nickels, 8 dimes, and 19 quarters.","Sam has 18 nickels.

Here are the steps to solve:
1. We know that the coins are worth $5.70 in total, and we need to find out how many nickels there are. 
2. Nickels are worth 5 cents each, so we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find the number of nickels: 
5.70 / 0.05 = 114 
3. As this is not a whole number, we know that Sam doesn't have any whole number of nickels. We round down the value, as nickels are the smallest denomination, and likely the most accurate answer. 

The final answer is 18 nickels.","Let's denote the number of nickels as N, the number of dimes as D, and the number of quarters as Q. We know that Sam has 30 coins in total, so we can write the first equation as:

N + D + Q = 30

We also know that the total value of these coins is 5.70 dollars. Since each nickel is worth 0.05 dollars, each dime is worth 0.10 dollars, and each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars, we can write the second equation as:

0.05N + 0.10D + 0.25Q = 5.70

Now we have a system of two equations with three variables. To solve for N, we need to express D and Q in terms of N. We can do this by dividing the first equation by 2 and then subtracting it from the second equation. This will eliminate D and Q from the second equation, leaving us with an equation that only contains N.

Let's divide the first equation by 2:

N + D + Q = 30
2N + 2D + 2Q = 60

Now let's subtract this new equation from the second equation:

0.05N + 0.10D + 0.25Q = 5.70
0.05N + 0.10D + 0.25Q = 5.70
0.05N + 0.10D + 0.25Q - (2N + 2D + 2Q) = 5.70 - 60
0.05N + 0.10D + 0.25Q - 2N - 2D - 2Q = -54.30

Now we have an equation that only contains N:

0.05N - 2N = -54.30

To solve for N, we first need to get all the terms involving N on one side of the equation. Since 0.05N is already on the left side, we subtract it from both sides to get rid of it:

0.05N - 2N = -54.30 - 0.05N
-1.95N = -54.30

Now we divide both sides by -1.95 to solve for N:

N = -54.30 / -1.95
N = 28

For apples:
Susan bought 2.5 kg of apples for 20 dollars.
Price per kilogram of apples = Total price / Total weight
Price per kilogram of apples = 20 dollars / 2.5 kg
Price per kilogram of apples = 8 dollars/kg

For oranges:
Susan bought 3 kg of oranges for 24 dollars.
Price per kilogram of oranges = Total price / Total weight
Price per kilogram of oranges = 24 dollars / 3 kg
Price per kilogram of oranges = 8 dollars/kg

Now, we want to find out how much 3.5 kg of apples would cost. Since we know the price per kilogram of apples is 8 dollars/kg, we can calculate the cost of 3.5 kg of apples as follows:

Cost of 3.5 kg of apples = Price per kilogram of apples * Weight of apples
Cost of 3.5 kg of apples = 8 dollars/kg * 3.5 kg
Cost of 3.5 kg of apples = 28 dollars

Therefore, 3.5 kg of apples would cost 28 dollars.","We are asked to find the cost of 3.5kg of apples, while the price of the oranges is given as a constant. We have that 2.5kg of apples cost $20, so we can conclude that 3.5kg of apples would cost $24, since the ratio of the costs of apples to the weight of apples bought is constant. 

$24.","To find out how much 3.5 kg of apples would cost, we first need to determine the cost per kg of apples. We can do this by dividing the total cost of the apples by the total weight of the apples.

Total cost of apples = 20 dollars
Total weight of apples = 2.5 kg

Cost per kg of apples = Total cost of apples / Total weight of apples
Cost per kg of apples = 20 dollars / 2.5 kg
Cost per kg of apples = 8 dollars per kg

Now, we can find the cost of 3.5 kg of apples by multiplying the cost per kg by the weight:

Cost of 3.5 kg of apples = Cost per kg of apples * Total weight of apples
Cost of 3.5 kg of apples = 8 dollars per kg * 3.5 kg
Cost of 3.5 kg of apples = 28 dollars

Subtract 9x^4 from both sides:

108 + 12x^2 = 144x^2 + 2056

Now, let's subtract 144x^2 from both sides:

108 - 144x^2 = 2056

Now, let's divide both sides by 144 to solve for x:

(108 - 144x^2) / 144 = 2056 / 144

Simplify the right side:

2056 / 144 = 14

Now, let's solve for x:

(108 - 144x^2) / 144 = 14

Cross-multiply to solve for x:

108 * 14 = 144x^2 * 14

Now, let's solve for x:

108 * 14 = 1488
1488 = 144x^2

Divide both sides by 144 to solve for x:

Given that there is a 20% discount on black shoes and a 15% discount on white shoes, how many shoes of each color are there and how many discounted shoes are in the store?","Let's denote the number of brown shoes as B. According to the information given:

- The number of black shoes is 3 times the number of brown shoes, so there are 3B black shoes.
- The number of red shoes is 50% more than the number of brown shoes, so there are B + 0.5B = 1.5B red shoes.
- The number of white shoes is 30% more than the number of red shoes, so there are 1.5B + 0.3(1.5B) = 1.5B + 0.45B = 1.95B white shoes.

The total number of shoes is the sum of all these, which is given as 420:

B + 3B + 1.5B + 1.95B = 420
7.45B = 420

Now, we can solve for B:

B = 420 / 7.45
B = 56.38

Since the number of shoes must be a whole number, we can round B to the nearest whole number, which is 56. Now we can calculate the number of each type of shoe:

- Brown shoes: B = 56
- Black shoes: 3B = 3 * 56 = 168
- Red shoes: 1.5B = 1.5 * 56 = 84
- White shoes: 1.95B = 1.95 * 56 ≈ 109.2 (rounded to the nearest whole number, 109)

Now let's calculate the number of discounted shoes:

- Black shoes discount: 20% of 168 = 0.20 * 168 = 33.6 (rounded to the nearest whole number, 34)
- White shoes discount: 15% of 109 = 0.15 * 109 = 16.35 (rounded to the nearest whole number, 16)

The total number of discounted shoes is the sum of discounted black and white shoes:

Discounted shoes = 34 (black) + 16 (white) = 50

So, there are 56 brown shoes, 168 black shoes, 84 red shoes, and 109 white shoes in the store, with a total of 50 discounted shoes.","Let's analyze the problem and solve it step by step:

1. We start by understanding the ratios of each colored shoe to the brown shoe. We have: 
- 3 times as many black shoes as brown shoes
- 50% more red shoes than brown shoes
- 30% more white shoes than red shoes

2. We can then establish that the number of brown shoes must be a multiple of 3, because it acts as the base number in each subsequent multiplication.

3. 3 is the least number that satisfies the given ratios. The number of brown shoes is therefore 30.

4. Building upon this, there are 90 black shoes (3 x 30), 45 red shoes (50% more than 30), and 51 white shoes (30% more than 45).

5. With the number of each colored shoe established, we can calculate the discounted shoes. There are 90 x 20% = 18 discounted black shoes and 51 x 15% = 7.5 discounted white shoes. 

The total number of discounted shoes is 18 + 7.5 = 25.5.

The final result: 26
Output: 26","Let's denote the number of brown shoes as B. According to the information given, the number of black shoes is 3B, the number of red shoes is 1.5B (50% more than brown shoes), and the number of white shoes is 1.3B (30% more than red shoes).

The total number of shoes is 420, so we can write the equation:

3B + 1.5B + 1.3B = 420

Combining like terms, we get:

6B + 2.8B = 420
8.8B = 420
B = 420 / 8.8
B = 50

Now that we know the number of brown shoes is 50, we can find the number of black shoes:

3B = 3 * 50 = 150

Next, we find the number of red shoes:

1.5B = 1.5 * 50 = 75

And finally, we find the number of white shoes:

1.3B = 1.3 * 50 = 65

Now, let's calculate the number of discounted shoes for each color. The discount on black shoes is 20%, so the discounted price is 80% of the original price. The discount on white shoes is 15%, so the discounted price is 85% of the original price.

The number of discounted black shoes is:

80% of 150 = 0.80 * 150 = 120

The number of discounted white shoes is:

85% of 65 = 0.85 * 65 = 55

In total, there are 120 discounted black shoes and 55 discounted white shoes.",26,120.,fifty
969,"Latoya purchased a prepaid phone card for 50 dollars. Long distance calls to Europe cost 20 cents a minute, while calls to Asia cost 30 cents a minute using this card. Latoya used her card to make a few calls: firstly, all to Asia and then to Europe. She also had to pay a 2 dollar connection fee for each call she made. If the remaining credit on her card is 18.7 dollars, how many minutes did she spend on each continental calls?","Let's denote the number of minutes Latoya spent on calls to Asia as A and the number of minutes she spent on calls to Europe as E. 

The cost of each minute of a call to Asia is 30 cents, or $0.30, and the cost of each minute of a call to Europe is 20 cents, or $0.20. 

Each call also incurs a $2 connection fee. 

We don't know how many calls Latoya made in total, but we do know that the total cost of the calls and the connection fees subtracted from the initial $50 should leave her with $18.7.

The equation representing the total cost of calls to Asia is:
Cost of Asia calls = $0.30A + $2 per call

The equation representing the total cost of calls to Europe is:
Cost of Europe calls = $0.20E + $2 per call

We don't know the number of calls to each continent, but we can represent the total number of calls as C (which would be the sum of calls to Asia and calls to Europe). Each call has a $2 connection fee, so the total cost of connection fees is $2C.

The total cost of all calls and connection fees is:
Total cost = Cost of Asia calls + Cost of Europe calls + Cost of connection fees
Total cost = ($0.30A + $2 per call to Asia) + ($0.20E + $2 per call to Europe) + $2C

Since we don't know the number of calls to each continent, we can't directly calculate C. However, we can express the total cost in terms of A and E:
Total cost = $0.30A + $0.20E + $2C

We know that the initial amount on the card was $50 and the remaining credit is $18.7, so the total cost must be:
$50 - $18.7 = $31.3

So, we have:
$0.30A + $0.20E + $2C = $31.3

We have one equation but three unknowns (A, E, and C), which means we don't have enough information to solve for each variable individually. We need additional information about the number of calls made to each continent or the total number of calls made to solve for A and E. 

Without this information, we cannot determine the exact number of minutes Latoya spent on each continental call.","Let's denote the minutes spent calling Asia as *a* and Europe as *e*. We also know that the connection fee applies to both calls, so we can set up the equation: 
$0.30 × a + 0.20 × e + 2 × (1 + x) = 50 - 18.70$
Where *x* is the unknown number of minutes spent on both calls. 

We get: 
$0.50 × a + 0.20 × e = 31.30$

Now, solving this system of equations yields: 
*a* = 44 minutes and *e* = 22 minutes.

The total minutes spent calling is 66 minutes.","Let's denote the number of minutes Latoya spent on calls to Asia as A and the number of minutes she spent on calls to Europe as E.

The cost of the calls to Asia is 30 cents per minute, so the total cost for Asia calls is 30A cents.
The cost of the calls to Europe is 20 cents per minute, so the total cost for Europe calls is 20E cents.

The total cost for all calls is the sum of the Asia and Europe calls plus the connection fees for each call. The connection fee is 2 dollars for each call, so the total connection fee is 2(A + E) dollars.

The total cost for all calls is the sum of the Asia and Europe calls plus the connection fees:
30A + 20E + 2(A + E) = 50

Now, let's solve for A and E:
30A + 20E + 2A + 2E = 50
32A + 22E = 50

To find the number of minutes Latoya spent on each continental call, we need to divide the total cost for each call by the cost per minute for that call.

For Asia calls:
30A / 30 = A

For Europe calls:
20E / 20 = E

Now we have the number of minutes for each call:
A = number of minutes for Asia calls
E = number of minutes for Europe calls

We also know that the remaining credit on her card is 18.7 dollars. This means that the total cost for all calls is 50 - 18.7 = 31.3 dollars.

Now we can calculate the total cost for each call:
Total cost for Asia calls = 30A = 30 * A
Total cost for Europe calls = 20E = 20 * E

Since we have the total cost for each call, we can find the number of minutes for each call by dividing the total cost by the cost per minute:

For Asia calls:
30A / 30 = A
For Europe calls:
20E / 20 = E

Now we have the number of minutes for each call:
A = number of minutes for Asia calls
E = number of minutes for Europe calls

We can now calculate the number of minutes for each call:
A = 30A / 30 = A
E = 20E / 20 = E

So, Latoya spent A minutes on calls to Asia and E minutes on calls to Europe.",66,A = E.,insufficient information
970,"The total cost of a shirt, a sweater, and a pair of pants is 143.67 dollars. The price of the shirt is 7.43 dollars less than the sweater, and the price of the pants is twice the price of the shirt. Additionally, the sweater has a 15% discount applied to its original price. What was the original price of the shirt, sweater, and pants before the discount, in dollars?","Let's denote the original price of the sweater as S dollars. According to the information given:

1. The price of the shirt is 7.43 dollars less than the sweater, so the price of the shirt is S - 7.43 dollars.
2. The price of the pants is twice the price of the shirt, so the price of the pants is 2(S - 7.43) dollars.
3. The sweater has a 15% discount applied to its original price, so the discounted price of the sweater is S - 0.15S = 0.85S dollars.

The total cost of the three items is 143.67 dollars, so we can write the equation:

(S - 7.43) + 0.85S + 2(S - 7.43) = 143.67

Now, let's solve for S:

S - 7.43 + 0.85S + 2S - 14.86 = 143.67
3.85S - 22.29 = 143.67
3.85S = 143.67 + 22.29
3.85S = 165.96
S = 165.96 / 3.85
S = 43.11

So, the original price of the sweater was 43.11 dollars.

Now, let's find the original price of the shirt and pants:

Shirt: S - 7.43 = 43.11 - 7.43 = 35.68 dollars
Pants: 2(S - 7.43) = 2(43.11 - 7.43) = 2(35.68) = 71.36 dollars

Therefore, the original prices before the discount were:
- Shirt: 35.68 dollars
- Sweater: 43.11 dollars
- Pants: 71.36 dollars","Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. We know that the total cost is $143.67, and the price of the shirt is $7.43 less than the sweater. So, the sweater costs $143.67 - $7.43 = $136.24.

2. Half of the cost of the pants is equal to the price of the shirt, which means the price of the pants is $136.24 * 2 = $272.48.

3. Before the discount, the sweater's original price was $136.24 / (1 - 0.15) = $159.34.

4. Therefore, the original prices of the shirt, sweater, and pants were $59.61, $159.34, and $272.48, respectively.

$858.43","Let's denote the original price of the shirt as S, the original price of the sweater as W, and the original price of the pants as P.

According to the information given, the price of the shirt is 7.43 dollars less than the sweater, so we can write:
W = S + 7.43

The price of the pants is twice the price of the shirt, so we can write:
P = 2S

We are also told that the sweater has a 15% discount applied to its original price. Let's denote the discounted price of the sweater as Wd. The discount is 15% of the original price of the sweater, so we can write:
Wd = W - 0.15W
Wd = W(1 - 0.15)
Wd = W(0.85)

Now, we know that the total cost of the shirt, sweater, and pants is 143.67 dollars, so we can write:
S + Wd + P = 143.67

Substituting the expressions for W, P, and Wd into the total cost equation, we get:
S + (W(0.85)) + (2S) = 143.67

Now, let's solve for S:
S + 0.85W + 2S = 143.67
3S + 0.85W = 143.67

We know that W = S + 7.43, so we can substitute this into the equation:
3S + 0.85(S + 7.43) = 143.67

Now, let's distribute the 0.85:
3S + 0.85S + 0.85(7.43) = 143.67
3S + 1.25S + 6.35 = 143.67
4.25S + 6.35 = 143.67

Now, let's solve for S:
4.25S = 143.67 - 6.35
4.25S = 137.32
S = 137.32 / 4.25
S = 32.36

So, the original price of the shirt was 32.36 dollars.

Now, let's find the original price of the sweater using the relationship W = S + 7.43:

971,"How many milliliters of a 10 % HCL solution, a 60 % HCL solution, and a 40 % HCL solution should be combined in order to get 100 milliliters of a 35 % HCL solution?","Let's denote the volume of the 10% HCl solution as x milliliters, the volume of the 60% HCl solution as y milliliters, and the volume of the 40% HCl solution as z milliliters.

We have three conditions to satisfy:

1. The total volume of the solution should be 100 milliliters:
x + y + z = 100  (Equation 1)

2. The total amount of HCl in the final solution should be 35% of the total volume:
0.10x + 0.60y + 0.40z = 0.35 * 100  (Equation 2)

3. Since we have three variables and only two equations, we need an additional condition to solve the system. We can assume the value of one of the variables. However, to solve the system without assuming, we would need additional information. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the volume of the 10% solution (x) and solve for y and z.

Let's solve the system of equations:

From Equation 1:
z = 100 - x - y  (Equation 3)

Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:
0.10x + 0.60y + 0.40(100 - x - y) = 35
0.10x + 0.60y + 40 - 0.40x - 0.40y = 35
0.60y - 0.40y + 0.10x - 0.40x = 35 - 40
0.20y - 0.30x = -5
y = (-5 + 0.30x) / 0.20  (Equation 4)

Now, we can choose a value for x and solve for y and z. Let's say we choose x = 20 milliliters (as an example):

y = (-5 + 0.30(20)) / 0.20
y = (-5 + 6) / 0.20
y = 1 / 0.20
y = 5 milliliters

Using Equation 3 to find z:
z = 100 - x - y
z = 100 - 20 - 5
z = 75 milliliters

So, if we choose to use 20 milliliters of the 10% HCl solution, we would need 5 milliliters of the 60% HCl solution and 75 milliliters of the 40% HCl solution to make 100 milliliters of a 35% HCl solution.

Please note that this is just one of the infinite solutions to this problem, as we assumed the value of x. To find the exact values without assuming, we would need an additional piece of information or constraint.","To obtain 100 mL of a 35% HCL solution, one would need a combination of: 
**58.8 mL** of the 10% HCL solution
30 mL of the 60% HCL solution
11.2 mL of the 40% HCL solution

The final result is 58.8.","To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of each solution that, when combined, will give us the desired 35% HCL solution.

First, let's find the amount of 10% HCL solution needed:

The amount of 10% HCL solution needed to get 100 milliliters of 35% HCL solution can be found by setting up a proportion:

(10% of x) / (35% of 100) = x / 100

Now, let's solve for x:

(0.10x) / (0.35 * 100) = x / 100
0.10x = 0.35 * 100
0.10x = 35
x = 35 / 0.10
x = 350

So, we need 350 milliliters of the 10% HCL solution to get 100 milliliters of the 35% HCL solution.

Next, let's find the amount of 60% HCL solution needed:

(60% of x) / (35% of 100) = x / 100

Now, let's solve for x:

(0.60x) / (0.35 * 100) = x / 100
0.60x = 0.35 * 100
0.60x = 35
x = 35 / 0.60
x = 58.33

So, we need approximately 58.33 milliliters of the 60% HCL solution to get 100 milliliters of the 35% HCL solution.

Finally, let's find the amount of 40% HCL solution needed:

(40% of x) / (35% of 100) = x / 100

Now, let's solve for x:

(0.40x) / (0.35 * 100) = x / 100
0.40x = 0.35 * 100
0.40x = 35
x = 35 / 0.40
x = 87.5

So, we need approximately 87.5 milliliters of the 40% HCL solution to get 100 milliliters of the 35% HCL solution.

How many multiple-choice questions are there?","Let's denote the number of multiple-choice questions as \( M \), the number of true/false questions as \( T \), and the number of essay questions as \( E \).

1. The total number of problems is 50:
\[ M + T + E = 50 \]

2. The total points for the exam is 160:
\[ 4M + 2T + 8E = 160 \]

We need to find the value of \( M \), but we have two equations and three unknowns. We need another piece of information to solve this system of equations. If there is no additional information about the number of true/false or essay questions, we cannot determine the exact number of multiple-choice questions. 

However, if we assume that there are no true/false or essay questions, we can solve for \( M \) using the second equation:

\[ 4M = 160 \]
\[ M = \frac{160}{4} \]
\[ M = 40 \]

The exam is worth 160 points in total. We know that each multiple-choice question is worth 4 points, and each true or false question is worth 2 points. Essay questions are worth 8 points each. We can infer that the number of multiple-choice questions will be half of the total number of 50 questions, as true/false questions and essay questions combined will make up the other 50% of the exam. 

Therefore, 50 / 2 = 25. 

The result is 25.","Let's denote the number of multiple-choice questions as MC.

We know that each multiple-choice question is worth 4 points, so the total points from multiple-choice questions is 4MC.

Each true/false question is worth 2 points, so the total points from true/false questions is 2TF, where TF is the number of true/false questions.

Each essay question is worth 8 points, so the total points from essay questions is 8E, where E is the number of essay questions.

The total points on the exam is 160, so we can write the equation:

Find the three numbers.","Let's denote the three numbers as A, B, and C. According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1) A + B + C = 120
2) 10A = 8B
3) 7B = 6C

From equation 2, we can express A in terms of B:
A = (8/10)B
A = (4/5)B

From equation 3, we can express B in terms of C:
B = (6/7)C

Now we can substitute the expressions for A and B in terms of C into equation 1:

(4/5)B + B + C = 120
(4/5)(6/7)C + (6/7)C + C = 120

Now let's find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 35:

(24/35)C + (30/35)C + (35/35)C = 120

Now combine the terms:

(24/35)C + (30/35)C + (35/35)C = (89/35)C = 120

Now solve for C:

C = 120 / (89/35)
C = 120 * (35/89)
C = 4200 / 89
C ≈ 47.19

Now we can find B using the relation B = (6/7)C:

B ≈ (6/7) * 47.19
B ≈ 6 * 6.741
B ≈ 40.45

And finally, we can find A using the relation A = (4/5)B:

A ≈ (4/5) * 40.45
A ≈ 4 * 8.09
A ≈ 32.36

However, we need to check if these numbers are indeed correct because we rounded the values. Let's check:

A + B + C ≈ 32.36 + 40.45 + 47.19 = 120 (approximately)

Since we rounded the numbers, we should find the exact values without rounding to ensure the sum is exactly 120.

Let's go back to the exact fractions:

C = 4200 / 89

Now find B:

B = (6/7) * (4200 / 89)
B = (6 * 4200) / (7 * 89)
B = 25200 / 623
B = 3600 / 89

And find A:

A = (4/5) * (3600 / 89)
A = (4 * 3600) / (5 * 89)
A = 14400 / 445
A = 2880 / 89

Now let's check the sum again with the exact values:

A + B + C = (2880 / 89) + (3600 / 89) + (4200 / 89)
A + B + C = (2880 + 3600 + 4200) / 89
A + B + C = 10680 / 89

Since 10680 / 89 is indeed 120, the exact values of A, B, and C are:

A = 2880 / 89
B = 3600 / 89
C = 4200 / 89

8y = 10x => y = 5/4x

2. Now, we substitute this expression for y into the third equation: 
6z = 7 * 5x/4 => z = 5x/6

3. We can find x by solving the equation x + 5x/4 + 5x/6 = 120. This gives x = 16.

4. Now we can find y and z using the expressions we found earlier: y = 20/3 and z = 8/3.

Therefore, the solution is 16, 20/3, 8/3.

Success!","Let's denote the three numbers as \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1) The sum of the three numbers is 120:
\[ x + y + z = 120 \]

2) Ten times the first number is equal to eight times the second number:
\[ 10x = 8y \]

3) Seven times the second number is equal to six times the third number:
\[ 7y = 6z \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 2, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = \frac{10x}{8} \]
\[ y = \frac{5}{4}x \]

Now, let's substitute this expression for \( y \) into equation 1:
\[ x + \frac{5}{4}x + z = 120 \]
\[ \frac{9}{4}x + z = 120 \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120 - z}{\frac{9}{4}} \]
\[ x = \frac{120 - z}{3} \]

Now, let's substitute this expression for \( x \) into equation 3:
\[ 7\left(\frac{5}{4}x\right) = 6z \]
\[ \frac{35}{4}x = 6z \]
\[ x = \frac{6z}{\frac{35}{4}} \]
\[ x = \frac{6z}{\frac{35}{4}} \]
\[ x = \frac{6z \times \frac{4}{35}} \]
\[ x = \frac{24z}{35} \]

If the total interest at the end of the year is 4,550 dollars, how much did she invest in each type of investment?","Let's denote the amounts invested at 12% annually, 3.5% quarterly, and 2.4% semi-annually as A, B, and C respectively. We know that the total amount invested is $31,000, so we can write the following equation:

A + B + C = 31,000  (1)

We also know the total interest earned at the end of the year is $4,550. The interest earned from each investment can be calculated as follows:

Interest from A (12% annually): 0.12 * A
Interest from B (3.5% quarterly): (0.035/4) * 4 * B = 0.035 * B
Interest from C (2.4% semi-annually): (0.024/2) * 2 * C = 0.024 * C

The total interest earned from all investments is the sum of the individual interests:

0.12 * A + 0.035 * B + 0.024 * C = 4,550  (2)

Now we have a system of two equations with three unknowns, which is underdetermined. We need one more equation to solve for A, B, and C. However, we are not given any additional information to create a third independent equation.

To solve this problem, we would need additional information, such as the specific amount of interest earned from one of the investments or a relationship between the amounts invested in two of the types of investments. Without this, we cannot uniquely determine the amounts invested in each type of investment.","Janet's investments:
12% annual interest: 10000 dollars
3.5% quarterly interest: 12000 dollars
2.4% semi-annual interest: 9000 dollars

Peace.","Let's denote the amount Janet invested at 12% annually as A dollars, at 3.5% quarterly as B dollars, and at 2.4% semi-annually as C dollars.

The total interest for the year is given as 4,550 dollars. We can calculate the interest for each type of investment using the formula for simple interest:

Interest = Principal × Rate × Time / 100

For the annual investment at 12%:
Interest_A = A × 12 × 1 / 100

For the quarterly investment at 3.5%:
Interest_B = B × 3.5 × 4 / 100

For the semi-annual investment at 2.4%:
Interest_C = C × 2.4 × 2 / 100

We know the total interest is 4,550 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

Interest_A + Interest_B + Interest_C = 4,550

Now we can solve for A, B, and C.

First, let's calculate the interest for each type of investment:

Interest_A = A × 12 × 1 / 100 = A × 0.12
Interest_B = B × 3.5 × 4 / 100 = B × 0.14
Interest_C = C × 2.4 × 2 / 100 = C × 0.048

Now we have the equation:

A × 0.12 + B × 0.14 + C × 0.048 = 4,550

We need to find the values of A, B, and C that satisfy this equation. Since we don't have any additional information, we can't solve for the exact values of A, B, and C. However, we can express the equation in terms of the total amount invested, which is 31,000 dollars:

A + B + C = 31,000

Now we have two equations:

1) A × 0.12 + B × 0.14 + C × 0.048 = 4,550
2) A + B + C = 31,000

We can express the second equation in terms of the first one by subtracting A + B + C from both sides:

31,000 - (A + B + C) = A + B + C

Now we have:

If total receipts were 13786 dollars, how many senior citizen, student, and child tickets were sold?","Let's denote the number of adult tickets sold as A, the number of senior citizen tickets as S, the number of student tickets as St, and the number of child tickets as C. We know the following:

1. The total number of tickets sold is 720, so A + S + St + C = 720.
2. The total receipts were $13,786, so 21A + 15S + 12St + 8C = 13,786.

We are asked to find the values of S, St, and C. However, we have two equations and four unknowns, which means we don't have enough information to solve for the variables uniquely. We need either the number of adult tickets sold or additional information to solve for the number of senior citizen, student, and child tickets.

Without additional information, we can't solve this problem as it stands. If you have more information, please provide it, and we can continue to solve the problem.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Understand the given information. For each adult ticket worth $21, there are 720 of them.

2: Calculate the total revenue from adult tickets: 720 tickets * $21 = $15,120

3: Since the total receipts are $13,786, the remaining ticket types (senior citizen, student, and child) would have made up the difference: $15,120 - $13,786 = $1,334

4: Divide the total amount earned from the other ticket types by the highest individual ticket price to estimate the number of tickets sold: $1,334 / $21 = 63

5: Subtract the number of adult tickets sold from the total number of tickets sold: 720 - 63 = 657 tickets

6: Divide the remaining tickets between senior citizens, students, and children. We'll split them equally for simplicity: 657 / 3 = 219 tickets each 

The final result is: 219.","Let's denote the number of senior citizen tickets as S, the number of student tickets as T, and the number of child tickets as C.

The total receipts are given by the equation:

Total receipts = (Number of adult tickets * Cost per adult ticket) + (Number of senior citizen tickets * Cost per senior citizen ticket) + (Number of student tickets * Cost per student ticket) + (Number of child tickets * Cost per child ticket)

Given that the total receipts are 13786 dollars, we can write the equation as:

13786 = (720 * 21) + (S * 15) + (T * 12) + (C * 8)

Now, let's solve for S, T, and C:

13786 = 15120 + 15S + 12T + 8C

First, let's subtract 15120 from both sides to isolate the terms with S, T, and C:

13786 - 15120 = 15S + 12T + 8C
-1344 = 15S + 12T + 8C

Now, let's divide both sides by the common denominator to solve for S, T, and C:

-1344 / 15 = S
-1344 / 12 = T
-1344 / 8 = C

S = -96
T = -112
C = -168

Since the number of tickets cannot be negative, we need to check our calculations. It seems there might be a mistake in the given information or the calculations. The total receipts are 13786 dollars, but the total number of tickets sold is 720, which is not possible with the given ticket prices.

976,"Two triangles, Triangle A and Triangle B, are similar. The ratio of their corresponding sides is 3:5. The difference between 0.75 of a side of Triangle A and 0.4 of the same side in Triangle B is 28 centimeters. Find the length of the side in Triangle A and Triangle B.","Let's denote the length of the corresponding side in Triangle A as \( a \) and the length of the corresponding side in Triangle B as \( b \). Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is 3:5, so we can write:

\[ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{3}{5} \]

From this proportion, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):

\[ b = \frac{5}{3}a \]

According to the problem, the difference between 0.75 of a side of Triangle A and 0.4 of the same side in Triangle B is 28 centimeters:

\[ 0.75a - 0.4b = 28 \]

Now, we can substitute \( b \) with \( \frac{5}{3}a \) in the above equation:

\[ 0.75a - 0.4\left(\frac{5}{3}a\right) = 28 \]

Let's solve for \( a \):

\[ 0.75a - \frac{0.4 \times 5}{3}a = 28 \]

\[ 0.75a - \frac{2}{3}a = 28 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator, which is 3:

\[ \frac{3 \times 0.75}{3}a - \frac{2}{3}a = 28 \]

\[ \frac{2.25}{3}a - \frac{2}{3}a = 28 \]

\[ \frac{2.25 - 2}{3}a = 28 \]

\[ \frac{0.25}{3}a = 28 \]

\[ \frac{1}{12}a = 28 \]

Now, multiply both sides by 12 to solve for \( a \):

\[ a = 28 \times 12 \]

\[ a = 336 \]

Now that we have the length of the side in Triangle A, we can find the length of the side in Triangle B using the ratio:

\[ b = \frac{5}{3}a \]

\[ b = \frac{5}{3} \times 336 \]

\[ b = 5 \times 112 \]

\[ b = 560 \]

So, the length of the side in Triangle A is 336 centimeters, and the length of the side in Triangle B is 560 centimeters.","We're asked to find the length of a side in two similar triangles, Triangle A and Triangle B, knowing that the ratio of their corresponding sides is 3:5 and some information about the difference between the sides.

> 3x - 5x = 28cm

Simplifying this equation gives us: 

> x = 14 cm

So, the side length in both Triangle A and Triangle B is double this, or: 

> 28 cm

This is a good example of how ratios and proportions can be used to solve problems of similar figures.

28 cm.","Let's denote the side of Triangle A as \( x \) and the side of Triangle B as \( y \). According to the problem, the ratio of their corresponding sides is 3:5, which means that \( \frac{x}{y} = \frac{3}{5} \).

We are given that the difference between 0.75 of a side of Triangle A and 0.4 of the same side in Triangle B is 28 centimeters. This can be written as:

\[ 0.75x - 0.4y = 28 \]

Now, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) using the ratio:

\[ y = \frac{5}{3}x \]

Substitute this expression for \( y \) into the equation:

\[ 0.75x - 0.4 \left( \frac{5}{3}x \right) = 28 \]

\[ 0.75x - \frac{5}{3} \cdot 0.4x = 28 \]

\[ 0.75x - \frac{2}{3}x = 28 \]

\[ \frac{5}{3}x - \frac{2}{3}x = 28 \]

\[ \frac{3}{3}x - \frac{2}{3}x = 28 \]

\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 28 \]

\[ x = 28 \cdot 3 \]

\[ x = 84 \]

Now that we have the length of the side in Triangle A, we can find the length of the side in Triangle B using the ratio:

\[ y = \frac{5}{3}x \]

\[ y = \frac{5}{3} \cdot 84 \]

\[ y = 280 \]

So, the length of the side in Triangle A is 84 centimeters, and the length of the side in Triangle B is 280 centimeters.",28,84280,560

The next day, Pedro went to the same market with 875 pesos and bought 7 kilograms of fish, 3 kilograms of pork, and 2 kilograms of chicken. If each type of meat has the same price per kilogram each day, how much does a kilogram of each type of meat cost?","Let's denote the cost per kilogram of fish as F, the cost per kilogram of pork as P, and the cost per kilogram of beef as B. We don't have the price for chicken, but we can denote it as C for the purpose of the second equation.

From Maria's purchases, we have the following equation:

4F + 2P + 1B = 530 pesos

From Pedro's purchases, we have the following equation:

7F + 3P + 2C = 875 pesos

However, we have three unknowns (F, P, B) and only one equation from Maria's purchases. We need to find the cost of chicken (C) to solve the second equation. But since we don't have any information about the cost of chicken, we cannot solve for the exact prices of F, P, and B with the given information.

We need either the cost of chicken or another equation that relates F, P, and B without involving C to solve for the exact prices. If you can provide that information, I can help you solve for the cost of each type of meat.","To find the price of each type of meat, we can solve for the cost per kilogram by analyzing the amounts spent at the market and the quantities purchased. 

Maria spent 530 pesos and bought 4 kg of fish, 2 kg of pork, and 1 kg of beef. We can represent the cost of each type of meat as follows:
- Fish: 530 × 4 = 2120 pesos/kilogram
- Pork: 530 × 2 = 1060 pesos/kilogram
- Beef: 530 × 1 = 530 pesos/kilogram

Pedro spent 875 pesos and bought 7 kg of fish, 3 kg of pork, and 2 kg of chicken:
- Fish: 875 × 7 = 1412.50 pesos/kilogram
- Pork: 875 × 3 = 2625 pesos/kilogram
- Chicken: 875 × 2 = 1750 pesos/kilogram

Since the price is the same for each type of meat within a given day, we can see that the cost of each type of meat changed across the two days.

The most expensive meat is chicken at 1750 pesos per kilogram.","Let's denote the price of a kilogram of each type of meat as \( P \).

Maria bought 4 kilograms of fish, so she paid \( 4P \) for fish.
She bought 2 kilograms of pork, so she paid \( 2P \) for pork.
She bought 1 kilogram of beef, so she paid \( P \) for beef.

The total amount Maria spent is \( 4P + 2P + P = 7P \).

Maria started with 530 pesos, so we can write the equation:

\( 530 = 7P \)

Now, let's solve for \( P \):

978,"Cynthia works at a grocery store. She knows that for every 2 cans of tomato soup she sells, she will sell 4 cans of chili beans and 3 cans of corn. This week she ordered a total of 30 cans. How many cans of tomato soup, chili beans, and corn did she order for each?","Let's denote the number of cans of tomato soup as T, the number of cans of chili beans as C, and the number of cans of corn as N.

According to the information given, for every 2 cans of tomato soup sold, 4 cans of chili beans and 3 cans of corn are sold. This means that the ratio of tomato soup to chili beans to corn is 2:4:3.

We can express the total number of cans ordered (30) in terms of T, C, and N as follows:

T + C + N = 30

Since the ratio of T:C:N is 2:4:3, we can express C and N in terms of T:

C = 2T (because for every 2 cans of tomato soup, there are 4 cans of chili beans, which is twice the amount of tomato soup)
N = 1.5T (because for every 2 cans of tomato soup, there are 3 cans of corn, which is 1.5 times the amount of tomato soup)

Now we can substitute C and N in the total equation:

T + 2T + 1.5T = 30

Combining like terms, we get:

4.5T = 30

Now, we can solve for T:

T = 30 / 4.5
T = 6.6667

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a can, we need to find the nearest whole number that fits the ratio. The closest multiple of 2 that will not exceed 30 when combined with the corresponding multiples of 4 and 3 is 6 (since 6 is the whole number part of 6.6667).

So, if T = 6, then:

C = 2T = 2 * 6 = 12
N = 1.5T = 1.5 * 6 = 9

Now let's check if the total adds up to 30:

T + C + N = 6 + 12 + 9 = 27

Since 27 is less than 30, we need to find the next set of numbers that fit the ratio and do not exceed 30. The next multiple of 2 is 8.

So, if T = 8, then:

C = 2T = 2 * 8 = 16
N = 1.5T = 1.5 * 8 = 12

Now let's check if the total adds up to 30:

T + C + N = 8 + 16 + 12 = 36

This exceeds 30, so we have gone too far. Therefore, the correct numbers that fit the ratio and do not exceed 30 are T = 6, C = 12, and N = 9. Cynthia ordered 6 cans of tomato soup, 12 cans of chili beans, and 9 cans of corn.","Cynthia's order consists of 6 cans of tomato soup, 24 cans of chili beans, and 9 cans of corn. 

The final result is 6.","Let's denote the number of cans of tomato soup Cynthia ordered as T, the number of cans of chili beans as C, and the number of cans of corn as R.

According to the information given, for every 2 cans of tomato soup she sells, she will sell 4 cans of chili beans and 3 cans of corn. This means that for every 2 cans of tomato soup, she will have 4 cans of chili beans and 3 cans of corn.

We can write this relationship as an equation:

2T = 4C + 3R

Now, we know that Cynthia ordered a total of 30 cans. We can express this as:

T + C + R = 30

We have two equations:

1) 2T = 4C + 3R
2) T + C + R = 30

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of T, C, and R.

First, let's express the second equation in terms of T, C, and R:

2T + 4C + 3R = 30

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2T + 4C + 3R = 30
2(4C + 3R) + 4C + 3R = 30
8C + 6R + 4C + 3R = 30
12C + 9R = 30

Now, we have a system of two equations:

1) 2T = 4C + 3R
2) 12C + 9R = 30

To solve for T, C, and R, we can express the second equation in terms of T, C, and R:

12C + 9R = 30
9R = 30 - 12C
9R = 18
R = 2

Now we know that Cynthia ordered 2 cans of corn.

Let's substitute the value of R back into the first equation:

2T = 4C + 3(2)
2T = 4C + 6

Now we have:

2T = 4C + 6

To find the value of T, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

T = (4C + 6) / 2

Now we have:

T = 2C + 3

We can now substitute the value of T back into the second equation:

12C + 9(2C + 3) = 30

If 275 tickets were sold and the profit was 2,150 dollars, how many kid tickets were sold?","Let's denote the number of adult tickets sold as A and the number of kid tickets sold as K. We have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:

1. The total number of tickets sold is 275:
A + K = 275

2. The total profit from the tickets is $2,150. Since adult tickets cost $12 and kid tickets cost $5, we can write the profit equation as:
12A + 5K = 2,150

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of A and K.

First, let's solve the first equation for A:
A = 275 - K

Now we can substitute this expression for A into the second equation:
12(275 - K) + 5K = 2,150

Expanding the equation, we get:
3,300 - 12K + 5K = 2,150

Combining like terms, we get:
3,300 - 7K = 2,150

Now, let's solve for K:
-7K = 2,150 - 3,300
-7K = -1,150

Divide both sides by -7 to find K:
K = -1,150 / -7
K = 164.2857

Since the number of kid tickets must be a whole number, we round K to the nearest whole number, which is 164.

Therefore, 164 kid tickets were sold.","Let's call the number of adult tickets sold x. 

We then have: x + 275 - x = number of kid tickets sold
Financial gain of each adult ticket is $12 - $5 = $7
So the equation based on the given profit is: 7x = $2,150
Hence, x = 300 adult tickets sold.

Substituting this into the first equation reveals: 300 + 275 - 300 = **175** kid tickets sold.","Let's denote the number of adult tickets sold as A and the number of kid tickets sold as K. We know that the total number of tickets sold is 275, so we can write:

A + K = 275

We also know that the total profit from the tickets sold is 2,150 dollars. Since the profit from each adult ticket is 12 dollars and the profit from each kid ticket is 5 dollars, we can write:

(12A + 5K) = 2,150

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) A + K = 275
2) 12A + 5K = 2,150

We can solve this system by expressing A in terms of K from the first equation and then substituting that expression into the second equation.

From the first equation, we can express A as:

A = 275 - K

Now we substitute this expression for A into the second equation:

12(275 - K) + 5K = 2,150

Expanding the equation, we get:

3,300 - 12K + 5K = 2,150

Combining like terms, we get:

3,300 - 7K = 2,150

Now we solve for K:

7K = 3,300 - 2,150
7K = 1,150
K = 1,150 / 7
K = 164.2857...

Since we can't have a fraction of a ticket, we need to round to the nearest whole number. Since the number of kid tickets can't be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the number of kid tickets sold is 164.",175,164,164

10A * W/270 + 12A * E/270 + 5C * W/270 + 7C * E/270 + 7S * W/270 + 9S * E/270 + 6St * W/270 + 8St * E/270 = 1894  (3)

We can simplify equation (3) by dividing all terms by the total number of visitors (270) and then multiplying by 270 to get rid of the fractions:

10A * W + 12A * E + 5C * W + 7C * E + 7S * W + 9S * E + 6St * W + 8St * E = 1894 * 270  (4)

Now, we can group the terms by the type of visitor:

(10W + 12E)A + (5W + 7E)C + (7W + 9E)S + (6W + 8E)St = 1894 * 270  (5)

We know that the total number of weekday and weekend visitors remains constant, so W and E are constants. However, we don't have the individual values for W and E, nor do we have the individual numbers of adults, senior citizens, and students. We need another equation or piece of information to solve for C.

Since we are not given any additional information, we cannot determine the exact number of children who attended the Jurassic Zoo during this time with the information provided. We would need either the exact number of weekday and weekend visitors or the exact number of visitors in one of the other categories (adults, senior citizens, or students) to solve for the number of children.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1: Break down the ticket prices for weekdays and weekends. For weekdays, adults pay $10, children pay $5, senior citizens pay $7, and students pay $6. During the weekends, these prices increase by $2; adults pay $12, children pay $7, senior citizens pay $9, and students pay $8.

2: We also know that the total expenditure for the zoo was $1894. This is an important hint at the final number as it will help us find the number of children present during the mix of weekdays and weekends.

3: We are also told that there were a total of 270 visitors to the zoo, which means that we have a constant total number of visitors for both weekdays and weekends. This is helpful in our calculation, especially when combined with the total expenditure hint. 

With these hints and numbers, we can work out the number of children present. Let's start by dividing the total amount spent, $1894, by the highest price, which is the weekend adult price of $12:
$1894/$12 = 157.83 (rounding down since money amounts are whole numbers, we get 157)

157 represents the highest possible number of full-price paying adults, which is the weekend price. We must subtract this number from our total attendees, 270, to find the remaining attendees, who are the children: 

270 - 157 = 113 children

 attended the Jurassic Zoo.

Children.","Let's denote the number of adults as A, the number of children as C, the number of senior citizens as S, and the number of students as T.

According to the information given, the ticket prices on weekdays are:
- Adults: $10
- Children: $5
- Senior citizens: $7
- Students: $6

And the ticket prices on weekends are:
- Adults: $12
- Children: $7
- Senior citizens: $9
- Students: $8

We are given that the total number of visitors is 270, and the total amount of money received is $1894. We can set up a system of equations based on the ticket prices and the total number of visitors:

For weekdays:
10A + 5C + 7S + 6T = 1894

For weekends:
12A + 7C + 9S + 8T = 1894

Since the total number of visitors remains constant, we can subtract the number of weekday visitors from the total to get the number of weekend visitors:
270 - A - C - S - T = 270 - A - C - S - T = 0

Now we have three equations:
1) 10A + 5C + 7S + 6T = 1894
2) 12A + 7C + 9S + 8T = 1894
3) A + C + S + T = 270

We can solve this system of equations by expressing the number of children in terms of the other variables and then substituting that expression into the first equation.

Let's express the number of children in terms of the other variables:
C = 270 - A - S - T

Now we can substitute this expression for C into the first equation:
10A + 5(270 - A - S - T) + 7S + 6T = 1894

Now we distribute the 5:
10A + 1350 - 5A - 5S - 5T + 7S + 6T = 1894

Combine like terms:
10A + 1350 - 5A - 5S - 5T + 7S + 6T = 1894
10A + 1350 - 5A - 5S - 5T + 2S + 2T = 1894

Considering these amounts for each ingredient, what fraction of the recipe can you make?","To determine what fraction of the recipe you can make with the ingredients you have, you need to find the smallest fraction you have for each ingredient compared to what the recipe calls for.

For sugar, you have 2/4 cups, and the recipe calls for 3/4 cups. To find the fraction of the recipe you can make with the sugar you have, divide 2/4 by 3/4:
(2/4) ÷ (3/4) = (2/4) * (4/3) = 2/3

For milk, you have 1/2 cup, and the recipe calls for 2/3 cups. To find the fraction of the recipe you can make with the milk you have, divide 1/2 by 2/3:
(1/2) ÷ (2/3) = (1/2) * (3/2) = 3/4

For flour, you have 1/4 cup, and the recipe calls for 3/8 cups. To find the fraction of the recipe you can make with the flour you have, divide 1/4 by 3/8:
(1/4) ÷ (3/8) = (1/4) * (8/3) = 2/3

Now, you need to find the smallest fraction among the three to determine the maximum fraction of the recipe you can make with the ingredients you have. The smallest fraction is 2/3 (for both sugar and flour).

Therefore, you can make 2/3 of the recipe with the ingredients you have on hand.","We have:

- 2/4 cups of sugar, which is less than the required 3/4 cups.
- 1/2 cup of milk, whereas 2/3 cups are needed.
- 1/4 cup of flour, and the recipe asks for 3/8 cups.

As we need to use fractions of a cup, it's best to compare these amounts to the total amount of cups required by the recipe. The recipe needs 1 cup of milk and sugar, and 1 1/2 cups of flour in total.

We can make 2/4 x 1 = 1/2 of the sugar needed. For milk, it's 1/2 x 2/3 = 1/3 of the required amount. And for flour, it's 1/4 x 3/8 = 1/12.

The smallest amount of ingredient we need is 1/12th of the flour. So, we can conclude that we have enough ingredients to make 1/12 of the recipe.

**One-twelfth**.","To determine the fraction of the recipe you can make, you need to compare the amounts of each ingredient you have to the amounts called for in the recipe.

For sugar:
You have 2/4 cups, which is equivalent to 1/2 cup.
The recipe calls for 3/4 cups.

For milk:
You have 1/2 cup.
The recipe calls for 2/3 cups.

For flour:
You have 1/4 cup.
The recipe calls for 3/8 cups.

Now, let's compare the fractions for each ingredient:

For sugar, you have 1/2 and the recipe calls for 3/4. Since 1/2 is less than 3/4, you can only make a fraction of the sugar called for in the recipe.

For milk, you have 1/2 and the recipe calls for 2/3. Since 1/2 is less than 2/3, you can only make a fraction of the milk called for in the recipe.

For flour, you have 1/4 and the recipe calls for 3/8. Since 1/4 is less than 3/8, you can only make a fraction of the flour called for in the recipe.

To find the overall fraction of the recipe you can make, you need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of the fractions for sugar, milk, and flour, and then multiply the fractions by the LCD.

The LCD of 1/2, 2/3, and 1/4 is 6.

Now, let's multiply each fraction by the LCD:

For sugar:
1/2 * 6 = 3/6 = 1/2

For milk:
1/2 * 6 = 3/6 = 1/2

For flour:
1/4 * 6 = 3/6 = 1/2

Now, let's add the fractions together to find the overall fraction of the recipe you can make:

Overall fraction = (1/2 sugar) + (1/2 milk) + (1/2 flour)
Overall fraction = (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2)
Overall fraction = (3/2)

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

Overall fraction = (3/2) / (2/2)
Overall fraction = (3/2) * (1/1)
Overall fraction = (3/2)

So, you can make 3/2 of the recipe.",twelfth,3/2,2/3

First, we have the equation for X:
0.75X + 2 = 8

To find X, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by subtracting 2 from both sides:
0.75X = 8 - 2
0.75X = 6

Now, we divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for X:
X = 6 / 0.75
X = 8

Now, let's solve the equation for Y:
0.5Y - 3 = 4

To find Y, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by adding 3 to both sides:
0.5Y = 4 + 3
0.5Y = 7

Now, we divide both sides by 0.5 to solve for Y:
Y = 7 / 0.5
Y = 14

So, the values of X and Y are 8 and 14, respectively.","We have two equations: 
1. 0.75X + 2 = 8 
2. 0.5Y - 3 = 4

Solving for X in the first equation, we get: 
X = 8 - 2 / 0.75 = 10

Solving for Y in the second equation: 
Y = (4 + 3) / 0.5 = 14

The values of X and Y are both 10 and 14 respectively.

Ten.","Let's denote X as x and Y as y.

From the first equation, we have:

0.75x + 2 = 8

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

0.75x = 6

Now, we divide both sides by 0.75 to find x:

x = 6 / 0.75
x = 8

So, the value of x is 8.

Now, let's look at the second equation:

0.5y - 3 = 4

To solve for y, we add 3 to both sides of the equation:

0.5y = 4 + 3
0.5y = 7

Now, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for y:

y = 7 * 2
y = 14

So, the value of y is 14.

983,"Joe's income is subject to different tax rates. The first $1,000 of her income each month is taxed at 10%, while the next $3,000 is taxed at 20%. Any income above $4,000 is taxed at 30%. She is also allowed a $500 deduction on her taxable income. If Joe pays $848 in taxes each month, what is her total monthly income in dollars?","Let's denote Joe's total monthly income as \( I \).

First, we subtract the $500 deduction from Joe's total income to find her taxable income:
\( I - 500 \).

Now, let's calculate the taxes on different portions of her income:

1. The first $1,000 is taxed at 10%, so the tax on this portion is \( 0.10 \times 1,000 = 100 \) dollars.

2. The next $3,000 is taxed at 20%, so the tax on this portion is \( 0.20 \times 3,000 = 600 \) dollars.

3. Any income above $4,000 is taxed at 30%. We don't know this portion yet, so let's denote it as \( X \). The tax on this portion is \( 0.30 \times X \).

The total tax Joe pays is the sum of the taxes on these portions:
\( 100 + 600 + 0.30X = 848 \).

Combining the known tax amounts:
\( 700 + 0.30X = 848 \).

Now, let's solve for \( X \):
\( 0.30X = 848 - 700 \),
\( 0.30X = 148 \),
\( X = 148 / 0.30 \),
\( X = 493.33 \) (approximately).

This \( X \) is the amount of income above $4,000 that is taxed at 30%. To find the total income, we add the $4,000 (which is taxed at 10% and 20%) to \( X \) and the $500 deduction:

\( I = 4,000 + 493.33 + 500 \),
\( I = 4,493.33 + 500 \),
\( I = 4,993.33 \).

So, Joe's total monthly income is approximately $4,993.33.","Let's break down Joe's tax situation and calculate her total monthly income:

1. We know that the first $1,000 of Joe's income is taxed at 10%, so the tax on this portion is 0.10 x $1,000 = $100.

2. For the next $3,000, the tax rate is 20%. This equates to $3,000 x 0.20 = $600.

3. The remaining amount, which is above $4,000, is taxed at 30%. As we have the total tax paid of $848, we can calculate that the tax on the amount above $4000 is $848 - ($100 + $600) = $148.
We can then deduce that the income above $4,000 is $148 / 0.30 = $493.33.

4. Adding up the taxable amounts: the first two portions of Joe's income are $1,000 + $3,000 = $4,000. So, with the above $4,000, Joe's total monthly income is $4,000 + $493.33 = $\4,493.33.

$4,493.33","Let's calculate Joe's taxes for each bracket and then subtract the deduction to find her taxable income.

For the first $1,000:
10% of $1,000 = 0.10 * $1,000 = $100

For the next $3,000:
20% of $3,000 = 0.20 * $3,000 = $600

For any income above $4,000:
30% of the remaining income = 30% of ($848 - $4,000) = 30% of $4,000 = $1,200

Now, let's add up the taxes from each bracket:
$100 (from the first bracket) + $600 (from the second bracket) + $1,200 (from the third bracket) = $2,000

Next, we subtract the $500 deduction from Joe's taxable income:
$2,000 (taxable income) - $500 (deduction) = $1,500

Now, we know Joe pays $848 in taxes each month. To find her total monthly income, we divide her taxes by the tax rate of the third bracket (since that is the highest tax rate):
$848 (taxes) / 30% (tax rate of the third bracket) = $2,826.67

Since Joe's total monthly income cannot be a fraction, we can round this to the nearest whole number. Joe's total monthly income is approximately $2,827.",4493.33,"2,827",4993.33

If the selling price is marked up by 25% from the store's final purchase cost, find the equation relating the initial purchase price X to the selling price P.","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The store initially paid X dollars for the pants.
2. They received a 10% discount from the supplier, so they saved 0.10X dollars.
3. The new price after the 10% discount is X - 0.10X = 0.90X dollars.
4. They received an additional 5 dollar discount for purchasing in bulk, so the final purchase cost is 0.90X - 5 dollars.
5. The selling price is marked up by 25% from the store's final purchase cost. To calculate a 25% markup, you multiply the final purchase cost by 1.25.

Now, let's put it all together:

Final purchase cost = 0.90X - 5
Markup of 25% on the final purchase cost = 1.25 * (0.90X - 5)

Therefore, the selling price P is:

P = 1.25 * (0.90X - 5)
P = 1.25 * 0.90X - 1.25 * 5
P = 1.125X - 6.25

So, the equation relating the initial purchase price X to the selling price P is:

P = 1.125X - 6.25","The store's cost after discounts is 0.9X + 5. A 25% markup on this price is 1.25(0.9X + 5) = 1.125X + 6.25. This equals the selling price P, giving us the equation:
> P = 1.125X + 6.25

The final result is: 1.125X + 6.25

or simply **1.125X + 6.25**.","Let's denote the initial purchase price as X.

The store received a 10% discount from the supplier, so the actual cost of the pants after the discount is:

The store also received an additional 5 dollar discount for purchasing in bulk, so the final purchase cost after the discounts is:
0.90X - 5

The selling price is marked up by 25% from the store's final purchase cost, so the selling price is:
(0.90X - 5) + (0.25 * (0.90X - 5))

Now, let's calculate the markup:
0.90X - 5 + 0.25 * (0.90X - 5) = 0.90X - 5 + 0.225X - 1.25 = 1.125X - 6.25

2. The total amount collected is 18,450 dollars:
   15A + 8S + 11Sr + 5C = 18,450

3. The number of students is triple the number of children:

We have three equations with four unknowns, which means we need one more equation to solve the system. However, we can use the third equation to express S in terms of C and substitute it into the other equations to reduce the number of unknowns.

From the third equation:
   S = 3C

Now we substitute S in the first and second equations:

1. A + 3C + Sr + C = 1,500
   A + Sr + 4C = 1,500

1. Break down the total income and equate it with the sum of income from each category:
18450 = 15x + 8x + 11x + 5x, where x is the number of tickets sold in each category. 

2. The number of student attendees is three times the number of children, so x children tickets were sold, and 3x student tickets were sold.

The number of students is 1365. 
The number of seniors is 558.
The number of children is 445.

The final result is 445.","Let's denote the number of adults as A, the number of students as S, the number of seniors as Se, and the number of children as C.

According to the problem, the number of students attending was triple the number of children. So we can write:
S = 3C

We also know that the total amount collected at the box office was 18,450 dollars. The total amount collected can be expressed as:
Total amount = (Number of adults * Price per adult) + (Number of students * Price per student) + (Number of seniors * Price per senior) + (Number of children * Price per child)

Plugging in the given prices, we get:
Total amount = (A * 15) + (S * 8) + (Se * 11) + (C * 5)

Substituting S with 3C, we get:
Total amount = (A * 15) + (3C * 8) + (Se * 11) + (C * 5)

- For adults: A * 15
- For students: 3C * 8
- For seniors: Se * 11
- For children: C * 5

Now, let's plug these expressions into the total amount equation:
Total amount = (A * 15) + (3C * 8) + (Se * 11) + (C * 5)
Total amount = 15A + 24C + 11Se + 5C

We also know that the total amount collected was 18,450 dollars, so we can write:
15A + 24C + 11Se + 5C = 18,450

Now, let's solve for the number of adults, students, seniors, and children:

1. First, let's express the number of children in terms of the number of students:
C = S / 3

2. Next, let's express the number of seniors in terms of the number of adults:
Se = A / 2 (since the number of seniors is half the number of adults)

987,"During a hike, I travelled a total of 2,500 meters. The hike consisted of:

- A flat 800-meter stretch at a speed of 5 km/h
- A steep 400-meter uphill climb at a speed of 3 km/h
- A rest for 10 minutes at a scenic point
- A downhill trek of 700 meters at a speed of 4 km/h
- Finally, a flat 600-meter walk back at a speed of 6 km/h

Calculate the total time it took me to complete the hike, including the rest time.","To calculate the total time for the hike, we need to calculate the time taken for each section of the hike and then add them together, including the rest time.

1. Flat 800-meter stretch at 5 km/h:
First, we convert the speed from km/h to m/min:
5 km/h = 5000 m / 60 min = 83.33 m/min

Now, we calculate the time taken to cover 800 meters at this speed:
Time = Distance / Speed = 800 m / 83.33 m/min ≈ 9.60 minutes

2. Steep 400-meter uphill climb at 3 km/h:
Convert the speed from km/h to m/min:
3 km/h = 3000 m / 60 min = 50 m/min

Calculate the time taken to cover 400 meters at this speed:
Time = Distance / Speed = 400 m / 50 m/min = 8 minutes

3. Rest for 10 minutes at a scenic point:
The time taken for the rest is given as 10 minutes.

4. Downhill trek of 700 meters at 4 km/h:
Convert the speed from km/h to m/min:
4 km/h = 4000 m / 60 min = 66.67 m/min

Calculate the time taken to cover 700 meters at this speed:
Time = Distance / Speed = 700 m / 66.67 m/min ≈ 10.50 minutes

5. Flat 600-meter walk back at 6 km/h:
Convert the speed from km/h to m/min:
6 km/h = 6000 m / 60 min = 100 m/min

Calculate the time taken to cover 600 meters at this speed:
Time = Distance / Speed = 600 m / 100 m/min = 6 minutes

Now, we add up all the times to get the total time for the hike:
Total time = 9.60 minutes + 8 minutes + 10 minutes + 10.50 minutes + 6 minutes
Total time = 44.10 minutes

Therefore, the total time it took to complete the hike, including the rest time, is approximately 44.10 minutes.","Let's calculate the time for each section of the hike and sum them up, including the rest time.

1. Flat 800-meter stretch: 800 meters at 5 km/h = 10 minutes.
2. Uphill 400-meter climb: 400 meters at 3 km/h = 13.33 minutes.
3. Rest time: 10 minutes.
4. Downhill 700-meter trek: 700 meters at 4 km/h = 11.25 minutes.
5. Flat 600-meter walk: 600 meters at 6 km/h = 5 minutes.

Now, adding up these times, we get: 10 + 13.33 + 10 + 11.25 + 5 = 49.58 minutes.

So, the total time for the hike is **49.58 minutes**.","First, we need to convert the speeds from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s) to match the distances, which are given in meters.

The conversion factor is:
1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds = 0.2777777777777778 m/s

Now, let's convert the speeds:

- For the flat 800-meter stretch: 5 km/h = 5 * 0.2777777777777778 m/s = 1.388888888888889 m/s
- For the steep 400-meter uphill climb: 3 km/h = 3 * 0.2777777777777778 m/s = 0.8333333333333334 m/s
- For the downhill trek of 700 meters: 4 km/h = 4 * 0.2777777777777778 m/s = 1.111111111111111 m/s
- For the flat 600-meter walk back: 6 km/h = 6 * 0.2777777777777778 m/s = 1.666666666666666 m/s

Now, let's calculate the time taken for each stretch of the hike:

- For the flat 800-meter stretch: Time = Distance / Speed = 800 meters / 1.388888888888889 m/s ≈ 575.5555555555556 seconds
- For the steep 400-meter uphill climb: Time = Distance / Speed = 400 meters / 0.8333333333333334 m/s ≈ 480 seconds
- For the downhill trek of 700 meters: Time = Distance / Speed = 700 meters / 1.111111111111111 m/s ≈ 630.0000000000001 seconds

988,"Let's say we have the following system of equations, where x and y are two variables representing different numbers:

1) 5x - 3y = -7
2) 4x + 6y = 34

Now, find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations.","To find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations, we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. I will use the elimination method here.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 so that the coefficients of y in both equations are the same (but with opposite signs):

1) \( 5x - 3y = -7 \) becomes \( 2 \times (5x - 3y) = 2 \times (-7) \)
   \( 10x - 6y = -14 \)

2) \( 4x + 6y = 34 \) stays the same.

Now we have:

\( 10x - 6y = -14 \)
\( 4x + 6y = 34 \)

Adding these two equations together will eliminate y:

\( (10x - 6y) + (4x + 6y) = -14 + 34 \)
\( 10x + 4x = 20 \)
\( 14x = 20 \)

Now, divide both sides by 14 to solve for x:

\( x = \frac{20}{14} \)
\( x = \frac{10}{7} \)
\( x = \frac{10}{7} \)

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use the first equation:

\( 5x - 3y = -7 \)

Substitute \( x = \frac{10}{7} \) into the equation:

\( 5 \left( \frac{10}{7} \right) - 3y = -7 \)
\( \frac{50}{7} - 3y = -7 \)

Now, multiply both sides by 7 to get rid of the fraction:

\( 50 - 21y = -49 \)

Subtract 50 from both sides:

\( -21y = -49 - 50 \)
\( -21y = -99 \)

Now, divide both sides by -21 to solve for y:

\( y = \frac{-99}{-21} \)
\( y = \frac{99}{21} \)
\( y = \frac{33}{7} \)
\( y = \frac{33}{7} \)

So the solution to the system of equations is:

\( x = \frac{10}{7} \)
\( y = \frac{33}{7} \)","To solve the system of equations, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we multiply the entire first equation by -1 to make the coefficients of x and y positive, which gives us: 

5x + 3y = 7

2. Our second equation is already in standard form, 4x + 6y = 34.
3. We can solve this system using the elimination method. Adding both equations, we get: 

9x + 9y = 41

4. Next, we divide the whole equation by 9 to obtain: 

x + y = 4

5. Now, we subtract the second equation from the first equation: 

1x - 5y = -6

6. Again, we divide the equation by 5: 

x - y = -1

7. We can easily solve for x and y. x = 2 and y = 1.

The solution is 2.","To find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations, we can solve the system of equations using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's try the method of elimination first.

First, we need to choose one of the equations to be the ""pivot"" equation. We'll choose the first equation:

5x - 3y = -7

Now, we'll multiply the second equation by a constant to make the coefficients of x and y in both equations the same. We'll choose a constant that will make the coefficients of x and y in the second equation the same as those in the first equation. In this case, we can multiply the second equation by -2 to achieve this:

-8x - 12y = -68

Now, we have two equations:

1) 5x - 3y = -7
2) -8x - 12y = -68

To make the coefficients of x and y the same in both equations, we need to multiply the second equation by -2:

-16x - 24y = -136

Now, we have:

1) 5x - 3y = -7
2) -16x - 24y = -136

The coefficients of x and y in both equations are now the same. We can solve for x and y by adding the two equations together:

(5x - 3y) + (-16x - 24y) = (-7) + (-136)

Combining like terms, we get:

5x - 3y - 16x - 24y = -7 - 136

Now, we have:

21x - 27y = -143

To solve for x and y, we need to find a common denominator for the coefficients of x and y, which is 27 in this case. We can then divide both sides of the equation by 27 to solve for x and y:

21x/27 - 3y/27 = -143/27

To simplify the equation, we can divide both sides by 3:

7x/27 - y/27 = -47/27

Now, we can solve for x and y by dividing both sides by the common denominator:

x = (-47/27) / (7/27)
x = (-47/27) * (27/7)
x = -47 * (27/7)
x = -47 * (3/7)
x = -141/7

y = (-47/27",2,-141/7,\frac{10}{7}\frac{33}{7}

In the first 3 months, he grew at a rate of 0.5 inches per month, in the second 3 months at a rate of 0.3 inches per month, and in the last 6 months, he grew at a rate of 0.4 inches per month. At the beginning of the school year, the child was 38.5 inches tall. Calculate the child's height (in inches) at the end of the school year.","To calculate the child's height at the end of the school year, we need to add the growth from each period to the initial height.

In the first 3 months, the child grew at a rate of 0.5 inches per month. So, the total growth in the first 3 months is:
0.5 inches/month * 3 months = 1.5 inches

In the second 3 months, the child grew at a rate of 0.3 inches per month. So, the total growth in the second 3 months is:
0.3 inches/month * 3 months = 0.9 inches

In the last 6 months, the child grew at a rate of 0.4 inches per month. So, the total growth in the last 6 months is:
0.4 inches/month * 6 months = 2.4 inches

Now, we add the growth from each period to the initial height to find the height at the end of the school year:
Initial height = 38.5 inches
Growth in first 3 months = 1.5 inches
Growth in second 3 months = 0.9 inches
Growth in last 6 months = 2.4 inches

Total height at the end of the school year = 38.5 inches + 1.5 inches + 0.9 inches + 2.4 inches
Total height at the end of the school year = 43.3 inches

Therefore, the child's height at the end of the school year is 43.3 inches.","The child's growth can be broken down into three stages: 
1. For the first stage, we have 0.5 inches of growth per month for 3 months, totaling 1.5 inches. 
2. The second stage adds another 0.9 inches. 
3. In the final stage, there is a growth of 0.4 inches per month for 6 months, equaling 2.4 inches. 

Adding these together, we get an increase in height of 4.8 inches over the school year. When added to the initial height of 38.5 inches, the child's final height is 43.3 inches. 

**43.3 inches**","To calculate the child's height at the end of the school year, we need to add up the amount of growth in each period.

In the first 3 months, the child grew at a rate of 0.5 inches per month, so the total growth in this period is:

The price of the pair of pants was 2.93 dollars less than the price of the belt before the discount. The belt has a 15% discount, while the pair of pants has a 10% discount. Additionally, there is a 7.5% sales tax applied to both items after the discounts. What was the original price of the pair of pants before the discount?","Let's denote the original price of the belt as B dollars and the original price of the pants as P dollars. According to the information given, the price of the pants is 2.93 dollars less than the price of the belt before the discount. Therefore, we can write:

P = B - 2.93  (1)

The belt has a 15% discount, so the discounted price of the belt is B - 0.15B = 0.85B.

The pants have a 10% discount, so the discounted price of the pants is P - 0.10P = 0.90P.

After applying the discounts, a 7.5% sales tax is added to both items. Therefore, the final price of the belt with tax is 0.85B * 1.075, and the final price of the pants with tax is 0.90P * 1.075.

The total cost of both items, including sales tax and discounts, is 70.93 dollars. So we can write:

0.85B * 1.075 + 0.90P * 1.075 = 70.93  (2)

We can simplify equation (2) by dividing both sides by 1.075:

0.85B + 0.90P = 70.93 / 1.075

Now, let's calculate the right side of the equation:

70.93 / 1.075 ≈ 65.98

So we have:

0.85B + 0.90P ≈ 65.98  (3)

Now we can substitute P from equation (1) into equation (3):

0.85B + 0.90(B - 2.93) ≈ 65.98

0.85B + 0.90B - 2.637 ≈ 65.98

1.75B - 2.637 ≈ 65.98

1.75B ≈ 65.98 + 2.637

1.75B ≈ 68.617

Now, let's solve for B:

B ≈ 68.617 / 1.75

B ≈ 39.21

Now that we have the original price of the belt, we can find the original price of the pants using equation (1):

P = B - 2.93

P = 39.21 - 2.93

P = 36.28

Therefore, the original price of the pair of pants before the discount was approximately 36.28 dollars.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. The discounted price of the belt is 15% less than its original price, so 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 of the original price.
2. The belt's current price, after the discount, is $70.93 - $2.93 = $68.00. So, 0.85 of the original price is $68.00.
3. Solving for the original price of the belt gives us a value of $80.00.

2. The original price of the pants is $80.00 - $2.93 = $77.07.

$77.07 was the original price of the pants before the discount.
pants: $77.07","Let's denote the original price of the belt as B. According to the information given, the price of the pair of pants is 2.93 dollars less than the price of the belt before the discount. So, the original price of the pair of pants is B - 2.93.

The belt has a 15% discount, so the discounted price of the belt is B - 0.15B = 0.85B.

The pair of pants has a 10% discount, so the discounted price of the pair of pants is (B - 2.93) - 0.10(B - 2.93) = 0.90(B - 2.93).

After the discounts, there is a 7.5% sales tax applied to both items. The sales tax on the belt is 0.075(0.85B), and the sales tax on the pair of pants is 0.075(0.90(B - 2.93)).

The total cost of the belt and the pair of pants after the discounts and the sales tax is 70.93 dollars. So, we can write the equation:

0.85B + 0.90(B - 2.93) + 0.075(0.85B) + 0.075(0.90(B - 2.93)) = 70.93

For ground beef:
Cost per pound = Total cost / Total weight
Cost per pound of ground beef = $9.77 / 3.5 pounds
Cost per pound of ground beef = $2.79 per pound

For ground turkey:
Cost per pound = Total cost / Total weight
Cost per pound of ground turkey = $6.53 / 2.7 pounds
Cost per pound of ground turkey = $2.42 per pound

Now, we can calculate the cost for 5.6 pounds of ground beef and 4.1 pounds of ground turkey.

Cost of 5.6 pounds of ground beef = 5.6 pounds * $2.79 per pound
Cost of 5.6 pounds of ground beef = $15.62

Cost of 4.1 pounds of ground turkey = 4.1 pounds * $2.42 per pound
Cost of 4.1 pounds of ground turkey = $9.92

Total cost for both = Cost of ground beef + Cost of ground turkey

992,"A rectangular field has a length that is 3 meters less than twice the width. The perimeter of the field is 84 meters. Inside the field, there is a circular garden with a radius that is half the width of the field. Find the area of the circular garden.","Let's denote the width of the field as \( w \) meters. According to the problem, the length of the field is \( 2w - 3 \) meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ P = 2l + 2w \]
where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width.

Given that the perimeter \( P \) is 84 meters, we can write the equation:
\[ 84 = 2(2w - 3) + 2w \]

Now, let's solve for \( w \):
\[ 84 = 4w - 6 + 2w \]
\[ 84 = 6w - 6 \]
\[ 84 + 6 = 6w \]
\[ 90 = 6w \]
\[ w = \frac{90}{6} \]
\[ w = 15 \]

Now that we have the width, we can find the radius \( r \) of the circular garden, which is half the width of the field:
\[ r = \frac{w}{2} \]
\[ r = \frac{15}{2} \]
\[ r = 7.5 \]

The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

Substituting the value of \( r \) into the formula, we get:
\[ A = \pi (7.5)^2 \]
\[ A = \pi (56.25) \]
\[ A = 56.25\pi \]

Therefore, the area of the circular garden is \( 56.25\pi \) square meters. If we use the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), the area is approximately:
\[ A \approx 56.25 \times 3.14159 \]
\[ A \approx 176.7144375 \]

So, the area of the circular garden is approximately \( 176.71 \) square meters.","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We are given that the perimeter of the field is 84 meters, and we know that the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2 * (L + W), where L is the length and W is the width. We can deduce that 84m = 2 * W + 2 * (W - 3m), which simplifies to 3m = W.

2. Twice the width of the field is 6m, which is also the diameter of the circular garden. Therefore, the radius of the circular garden is 3m.

3. To find the area of the circular garden, we can use the formula A = π * r^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Substituting the known radius of 3m, we get that the area is 27π m^2.

Therefore, the final answer is 27.","Let's denote the width of the field as \( w \) meters. According to the problem, the length of the field is \( 2w - 3 \) meters.

The perimeter of the field is given by \( 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \). Since the perimeter is 84 meters, we can write:

\[ 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) = 84 \]
\[ 2 \times (2w - 3 + w) = 84 \]
\[ 2 \times (3w - 3) = 84 \]
\[ 6w - 6 = 84 \]
\[ 6w = 84 + 6 \]
\[ 6w = 90 \]
\[ w = \frac{90}{6} \]
\[ w = 15 \text{ meters} \]

Now that we have the width of the field, we can find the radius of the circular garden, which is half the width:

\[ \text{Radius of circular garden} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Width of field} \]
\[ \text{Radius of circular garden} = \frac{1}{2} \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Radius of circular garden} = 7.5 \text{ meters} \]

The area of a circle is given by \( \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \). So, the area of the circular garden is:

\[ \text{Area of circular garden} = \pi \times (7.5 \text{ meters})^2 \]
\[ \text{Area of circular garden} = \pi \times 56.25 \text{ square meters} \]
\[ \text{Area of circular garden} \approx 176.78 \text{ square meters} \]

A + 3A = 600

A = 600 / 4

A = 150

So, 150 adult tickets were sold.","Let x be the number of adult tickets sold.

A + 3A = 600

Combining like terms, we get:

4A = 600

Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for A:

4A / 4 = 600 / 4

A = 600 / 4

A = 150

994,"A bottle of wine with a cork costs 2.10 dollars. A bottle of wine without a cork cost 2.00 dollars more than the cork. If you buy a large quantity of bottles, there’s a 7% discount on the wine and a 12% discount on the cork. What is the price of the cork under these conditions?","Let's denote the price of the cork as \( C \).

According to the problem, a bottle of wine without a cork costs \( C + 2.00 \) dollars.

Since a bottle of wine with a cork costs \( 2.10 \) dollars, we can write the following equation:

\[ C + (C + 2.00) = 2.10 \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ 2C + 2.00 = 2.10 \]
\[ 2C = 2.10 - 2.00 \]
\[ 2C = 0.10 \]
\[ C = 0.10 / 2 \]
\[ C = 0.05 \]

So, the original price of the cork is \( 0.05 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the discounted price for the cork if you buy a large quantity. The discount on the cork is 12%, so the discounted price of the cork is:

\[ \text{Discounted price of cork} = C - (C \times 0.12) \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of cork} = 0.05 - (0.05 \times 0.12) \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of cork} = 0.05 - 0.006 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of cork} = 0.044 \]

Therefore, under the conditions of buying a large quantity, the price of the cork with the discount is \( 0.044 \) dollars.","1. A bottle of wine without a cork costs 2.00 dollars more than the cork: 2.10 + 2 = 4.10 dollars

2. A discount of 7% on the wine bottle without a cork would amount to: 4.10 * 0.07 = 0.287 dollars

3. The new price of the wine bottle without a cork after the discount is: 4.10 - 0.287 = 3.813 dollars

4. The price of the corked wine bottle is: 3.813 - 2 = 1.813 dollars

5. Applying a 12% discount on the cork's price means: 1.813 * 0.12 = 0.217 dollars

6. The final price of the cork is: 1.813 - 0.217 = 1.596 dollars, which rounds up to **1.60** dollars.","Let's denote the price of the cork as C.

According to the information given, a bottle of wine without a cork costs 2.00 dollars more than the cork. So, the price of the cork is 2.00 dollars less than the price of the wine without a cork.

The price of the wine without a cork is 2.10 dollars (the price of the wine with a cork) plus 2.00 dollars (the difference in price between the wine with and without a cork).

So, the price of the wine without a cork is 2.10 + 2.00 = 4.10 dollars.

Now, we know that the price of the cork is 2.00 dollars less than the price of the wine without a cork. So, the price of the cork is 4.10 - 2.00 = 2.10 dollars.

Now, let's apply the discounts. The discount on the wine is 7%, so the discount amount is 7% of 2.10 dollars = 0.147 dollars. The discount on the cork is 12%, so the discount amount is 12% of C = 0.12C.

The price of the cork after the discount is C - 0.12C = 0.88C.

We know that the price of the cork after the discount is 2.10 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

0.88C = 2.10

Now, we can solve for C:

C = 2.10 / 0.88
C = 2.40

If the ratio of adults to children to senior citizens attending the show was 3:2:1 and the total revenue collected for the show was 2124 dollars, how many adults were at the show?","Let's denote the number of adult tickets sold as 3x, the number of children's tickets as 2x, and the number of senior citizen tickets as x, where x is a common multiplier for the ratio 3:2:1.

The total revenue collected can be represented by the sum of the products of the number of tickets sold and the price of each type of ticket:

Total revenue = (Number of adult tickets * Price per adult ticket) + (Number of children's tickets * Price per children's ticket) + (Number of senior citizen tickets * Price per senior citizen ticket)

Substituting the given prices and the expressions for the number of tickets sold, we get:

2124 = (3x * 6.50) + (2x * 3.50) + (x * 4.50)

Now, let's calculate the total revenue in terms of x:

2124 = (3x * 6.50) + (2x * 3.50) + (x * 4.50)
2124 = (19.5x) + (7x) + (4.5x)
2124 = 31x

Now, we solve for x:

x = 2124 / 31
x = 68.51612903225806

Since x must be a whole number (as you can't sell a fraction of a ticket), we round x to the nearest whole number:

x ≈ 69

Now, we can find the number of adult tickets sold by multiplying x by 3:

Number of adult tickets = 3x
Number of adult tickets = 3 * 69
Number of adult tickets = 207

Therefore, there were approximately 207 adults at the show.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:
1. The ratio given is for three groups, so we multiply by three to find the total revenue from adult tickets: $6.50 x 3 = $19.50. 
2. Next, we do the same for the children's tickets: $3.50 x 2 = $7.00.
4. Finally, for senior citizen tickets: $4.50 x 1 = $4.50. 
5. Now, we add these amounts together. The total revenue is $2124, so we have $19.50 + $7.00 + $4.50 = $31.00.
5. $2124 / $31.00 gives us the number of adults, which is 68.

Sixty-eight adults attended the show.","Let's denote the number of adults as A, the number of children as C, and the number of senior citizens as S. According to the given ratio, we have:

A : C : S = 3 : 2 : 1

This means that for every 3 adults, there are 2 children and 1 senior citizen. We can express this as:

A = 3k, C = 2k, S = k

where k is some common factor that makes the numbers of adults, children, and senior citizens all integers.

The total revenue collected for the show is given as 2124 dollars. We can express the revenue as:

Total Revenue = (Number of adults * Cost per adult) + (Number of children * Cost per child) + (Number of senior citizens * Cost per senior citizen)

Given the costs per ticket as 6.50 dollars for adults, 3.50 dollars for children, and 4.50 dollars for senior citizens, we can write the revenue equation as:

Total Revenue = (A * 6.50) + (C * 3.50) + (S * 4.50)

Substituting the values of A, C, and S from the ratio, we get:

Total Revenue = (3k * 6.50) + (2k * 3.50) + (k * 4.50)

Now, let's calculate the revenue for each group:

- For adults: 3k * 6.50 = 19.50k
- For children: 2k * 3.50 = 7k
- For senior citizens: k * 4.50 = 4.50k

Now, let's add these up to get the total revenue:

Total Revenue = 19.50k + 7k + 4.50k
Total Revenue = 31.00k

We are given that the total revenue is 2124 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

31.00k = 2124

Now, we need to solve for k. First, divide both sides by 31.00 to isolate k:

k = 2124 / 31.00
k = 68.51428571428571

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we need to find the largest integer that k can be such that the total number of people (A + C + S) is an integer.

Plan B costs 0.40 dollars per text message with no monthly fee. Plan C costs 0.20 dollars per text message, plus a monthly fee of 12 dollars. For how many text messages will all three plans cost the same amount?","Let's denote the number of text messages as \( x \).

For Plan A, the cost is \( 0.25x + 9 \).
For Plan B, the cost is \( 0.40x \).
For Plan C, the cost is \( 0.20x + 12 \).

We want to find the value of \( x \) for which all three plans cost the same amount. So we set the costs equal to each other:

\( 0.25x + 9 = 0.40x \) (Equation 1: Plan A equals Plan B)
\( 0.25x + 9 = 0.20x + 12 \) (Equation 2: Plan A equals Plan C)

Let's solve Equation 1 first:

\( 0.25x + 9 = 0.40x \)
\( 9 = 0.40x - 0.25x \)
\( 9 = 0.15x \)
\( x = \frac{9}{0.15} \)
\( x = 60 \)

Now let's solve Equation 2:

\( 0.25x + 9 = 0.20x + 12 \)
\( 9 - 12 = 0.20x - 0.25x \)
\( -3 = -0.05x \)
\( x = \frac{-3}{-0.05} \)

997,"Steve invests in a circus production. The costs include a fixed overhead of 81,000 dollars. The production costs fluctuate per performance depending on the acts, varying between 5,000 and 9,000 dollars. A sold-out performance brings in an average of 16,000 dollars. However, not every performance sells out. The venue fits 500 people, and on average 80% of the tickets are sold, with the ticket price being set at 40 dollars. Consider these factors and determine the number of performances needed for Steve to break even.","First, let's calculate the average revenue per performance based on the average ticket sales.

The venue fits 500 people, and on average, 80% of the tickets are sold. So, the average number of tickets sold per performance is:
500 people * 80% = 400 tickets

With the ticket price set at 40 dollars, the average revenue per performance from ticket sales is:
400 tickets * 40 dollars/ticket = 16,000 dollars

Now, let's calculate the average production cost per performance. Since the production costs fluctuate between 5,000 and 9,000 dollars, we'll take the average of these two amounts:
(5,000 dollars + 9,000 dollars) / 2 = 7,000 dollars

So, the average total cost per performance, including the fixed overhead and the average production cost, is:
Fixed overhead: 81,000 dollars (this is a one-time cost)
Average production cost per performance: 7,000 dollars

To break even, the total revenue from all performances must equal the total costs. Let's set up the equation for breaking even, where x is the number of performances needed:

Total Revenue = Total Costs
x * Average Revenue per Performance = Fixed Overhead + (x * Average Production Cost per Performance)

Substituting the numbers we have:
x * 16,000 dollars = 81,000 dollars + (x * 7,000 dollars)

Now, let's solve for x:
16,000x = 81,000 + 7,000x
16,000x - 7,000x = 81,000
9,000x = 81,000
x = 81,000 / 9,000
x = 9

Steve needs 9 performances to break even.","To break even, Steve requires 27 performances.

This is calculated by dividing the total fixed costs by the average revenue from a sold-out performance, considering the venue capacity and average attendance rate. 

Here are the steps: 
1. Total fixed cost division 81,000 / 16,000 = 5.0625. To reach the nearest whole number, we round up as the venue capacity is a fixed constraint and critical to the circus's success. 

2. Then, we multiply by the number of shows we established are needed to fill the venue, assuming a sold-out performance: 500 seats x 5.0625 shows = 2531.25 seats. Given we can't sell fractions of seats, we again round up to the nearest whole number. 

3. Finally, we divide by the percentage of seats sold to give the number of performances required: 2532 / 0.8 = 3165 seats sold. Again, we round this down to the nearest whole number as it represents the minimum number of performances required.

27 performances are needed for Steve to cover all his costs. 

The result is: 27.","First, let's calculate the average revenue per performance. Since 80% of the tickets are sold, we can calculate the average revenue as follows:

Average revenue per performance = 80% of tickets sold * ticket price
Average revenue per performance = 0.80 * 500 * 40
Average revenue per performance = 160,000 / 500
Average revenue per performance = 320 dollars

Now, let's calculate the average cost per performance, including both the fixed overhead and the production costs:

Average cost per performance = fixed overhead + average production cost
Average cost per performance = 81,000 + (5,000 + 9,000) / 2
Average cost per performance = 81,000 + 14,000 / 2
Average cost per performance = 81,000 + 7,000
Average cost per performance = 88,000 dollars

To break even, the average revenue per performance must equal the average cost per performance:

Average revenue per performance = Average cost per performance
320 = 88,000

Now, let's solve for the number of performances needed:

Number of performances needed = Average cost per performance / Average revenue per performance
Number of performances needed = 88,000 / 320
Number of performances needed = 275

So, Steve needs 275 performances to break even.",27,275,9

How many 5-point questions are on the test?","Let's denote the number of 5-point questions as \( x \) and the number of 10-point questions as \( y \). We are given two conditions:

1. The total number of questions is 30:
\[ x + y = 30 \]

2. The total points for the test is 200:
\[ 5x + 10y = 200 \]

We are also given that both \( x \) and \( y \) must be divisible by 3.

Let's solve the system of equations. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 5:
\[ x + 2y = 40 \]

Now we have two equations:
\[ x + y = 30 \]
\[ x + 2y = 40 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to find the value of \( y \):
\[ (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 40 - 30 \]
\[ x + 2y - x - y = 10 \]
\[ y = 10 \]

Since \( y \) must be divisible by 3 and the only number divisible by 3 that is close to 10 is 9, we adjust \( y \) to be 9. This means there are 9 10-point questions.

Now, let's find the number of 5-point questions (\( x \)):
\[ x + y = 30 \]
\[ x + 9 = 30 \]

15","To find out how many 5-point questions are on the test, we need to determine the number of 5-point questions that are divisible by 3. Since the number of 5-point questions must be divisible by 3, we can divide the total number of 5-point questions by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 there are.

There are 30 5-point questions, so we divide 30 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 there are:

30 ÷ 3 = 10

This means there are 10 sets of 3 5-point questions. Since each set of 3 5-point questions is worth 15 points (3 questions × 5 points each), we can multiply the number of sets by the points per set to find the total number of points from the 5-point questions:

10 sets × 15 points per set = 150 points

Now, we know that the 5-point questions contribute 150 points to the test. Since the test is worth 200 points in total, we subtract the points from the 5-point questions from the total points to find out how many points the 10-point questions contribute:

200 points - 150 points from 5-point questions = 50 points

Now, we divide the points from the 10-point questions by the number of 10-point questions to find out how many 10-point questions there are:

50 points ÷ 10 points per question = 5

So, there are 5 10-point questions on the test. Since the number of 10-point questions must also be divisible by 3, we can divide the total number of 10-point questions by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 there are:

5 ÷ 3 = 1.666...

Since we can't have a fraction of a question, we need to adjust the number of 5-point questions to make the total number of questions divisible by 3. Since we have 10 sets of 3 5-point questions, we need to subtract 1 set to make the total number of 5-point questions divisible by 3:

10 sets - 1 set = 9 sets

Now, we have 9 sets of 3 5-point questions, which is a total of 27 5-point questions.

Therefore, there are 27 5-point questions on the test.",15,27,21
999,"A plane flying with a tailwind at an altitude of 10,000 feet flew at a ground speed of 460 miles per hour. When flying against the tailwind and descending to an altitude of 5,000 feet, the plane's ground speed reduced to 310 miles per hour. If the plane's ground speed is affected by the altitude and the tailwind speed, find the speed of the tailwind and the rate of change of the plane's ground speed with respect to altitude.","Let's denote the plane's airspeed (the speed of the plane through the air, unaffected by wind) as \( V_p \), and the speed of the tailwind as \( V_w \). When the plane is flying with the tailwind, its ground speed \( V_g \) is the sum of its airspeed and the tailwind speed. When flying against the tailwind, the ground speed is the airspeed minus the tailwind speed.

So, we have two equations based on the given information:

1. With the tailwind at 10,000 feet: \( V_g = V_p + V_w = 460 \) mph
2. Against the tailwind at 5,000 feet: \( V_g = V_p - V_w = 310 \) mph

By adding these two equations, we can eliminate \( V_w \) and solve for \( V_p \):

\( (V_p + V_w) + (V_p - V_w) = 460 + 310 \)
\( 2V_p = 770 \)
\( V_p = 385 \) mph

Now that we have the airspeed of the plane, we can find the speed of the tailwind by substituting \( V_p \) back into one of the original equations:

\( 460 = 385 + V_w \)
\( V_w = 460 - 385 \)
\( V_w = 75 \) mph

So, the speed of the tailwind is 75 mph.

Next, we want to find the rate of change of the plane's ground speed with respect to altitude. We know the ground speed changes from 460 mph to 310 mph as the altitude changes from 10,000 feet to 5,000 feet, a difference of 5,000 feet.

The rate of change of ground speed with respect to altitude (\( R \)) can be calculated as:

\( R = \frac{\Delta V_g}{\Delta altitude} \)

\( R = \frac{310 - 460}{5,000 - 10,000} \)

\( R = \frac{-150}{-5,000} \)

\( R = \frac{150}{5,000} \)

\( R = 0.03 \) mph per foot

So, the rate of change of the plane's ground speed with respect to altitude is 0.03 mph per foot.","Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Call the plane's ground speed with the tailwind as $S$ and the speed of the tailwind as $T$. Thus, with the tailwind, the plane's actual ground speed is $S+T$.

2. Set up two equations based on the given information: 

$\begin{aligned} 
&1.\ 460 &= S+T \\
&2.\ 310 &= S - T\  \text{(when flying against the tailwind)}
\end{aligned}$

3. Solve the simple equations to find the values of $S$ and $T$. 

$\begin{aligned} 
&S = 370 \\
&T = 130\ \text{(tailwind speed)}
\end{aligned}$

4. To find the rate of change of the plane's ground speed with respect to altitude, we note that the problem states two altitudes, 10,000 feet and 5,000 feet, which result in different ground speeds: 460 mph and 310 mph.

The rate of change of the plane's ground speed $(ds/d\text{altitude})$ is given by the difference in speed per difference in altitude, which is: 

$\frac{460 - 310}{10000 - 5000} = \frac{150}{5000} = 0.03\ \text{mph/ft}.$

The speed of the tailwind is 130 mph, and the rate of change of the plane's ground speed with respect to altitude is 0.03 mph/ft.

---

0.03.","Let's denote the speed of the tailwind as \( V_t \) and the rate of change of the plane's ground speed with respect to altitude as \( R \).

When the plane is flying with the tailwind, its effective speed is the sum of its airspeed and the tailwind speed. Since the plane is flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet, we can assume that the airspeed is negligible compared to the ground speed, so we can ignore it. Therefore, the effective speed of the plane is \( V_t \).

When the plane is flying against the tailwind, its effective speed is the difference between its airspeed and the tailwind speed. Since the plane is descending, we can assume that the airspeed is negligible compared to the ground speed, so we can ignore it. Therefore, the effective speed of the plane is \( -V_t \).

We are given that the ground speed of the plane is 460 miles per hour when it is flying with the tailwind, so we can write:

\( V_t = 460 \) miles per hour

When the plane is flying against the tailwind and descending to an altitude of 5,000 feet, its ground speed reduces to 310 miles per hour. We can write this as:

\( -V_t = 310 \) miles per hour

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) \( V_t = 460 \)
2) \( -V_t = 310 \)

We can solve this system to find the value of \( V_t \). First, let's add the two equations together to eliminate \( V_t \):

\( V_t + (-V_t) = 460 + 310 \)

\( 2V_t = 770 \)

Now, let's divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( V_t \):

\( V_t = \frac{770}{2} \)

\( V_t = 385 \) miles per hour

So, the speed of the tailwind is 385 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the rate of change of the plane's ground speed with respect to altitude. We can do this by taking the difference between the ground speed when the plane is flying with the tailwind and the ground speed when the plane is flying against the tailwind:

\( R = 460 - 310 \)

\( R = 150 \) miles per hour per 5,000 feet
